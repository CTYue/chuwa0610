## 2.  What is MVC pattern?
- Model is a container used to transfer data between different parts of the application. 
  In MVC, it is responsible for handling data logic and storage.
- The controller processes the user's request, and obtains data from the data source according to the type of request (such as form submission, database query, Web service call, etc.), 
  and encapsulates the data into the Model. The controller passes the Model to the front controller, which then forwards it to the view resolver.
- View (Template) receives the model containing data. It reads the model and displays the data. 
  Spring MVC supports a number of view templates such as JSP or JSTL.
## 3.  What is Front-Controller?
```text
 Front-Controller receives all requests for a web application. It processes the requests and forwards them to the appropriate handler or view. 
`DispatcherServlet` is the Front-Controller in Spring MVC.
```
## 4.  What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.
```text
   1. Web server receives Http Requests and handle it to `DispatcherServlet`.
   2. `DispatcherServlet` calls `HandlerMapper`  to find the corresponding Controller to handle the request. 
       `HandlerMapper` returns the controller and method to `DispatcherServlet`.
   3. `DispatcherServlet` calls the method in the right controller and 
        controller calls service then retrieve data from database (or do operations). 
   4. Result (`ModelAndView`) will be put in to model by Controller and then returned to `DispatcherServlet`. 
   5. `DispatcherServlet` calls the ViewResolver with the view name.
   6. `ViewResolver` will find the corresponding view template.
   7. `ViewEngine` will generate html with the view template and the model.
   8. Html will be returned to client by `DispatcherServlet`
```
## 5.  What is JSP and What is ModelAndView？(please google to have a basic knowlege)
```text
JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology used for creating dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types. 
It is a part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform. JSP is essentially a simplified form of Servlet
```
## 6.  Could you please google any other servlets(理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间，知道servlet的名字就行。)
```text
HttpServlet
Handles HTTP requests and responses, the most commonly used servlet.

GenericServlet
A protocol-independent servlet that can be extended for different types of protocols.

AsyncServlet
Supports asynchronous processing, allowing long-running tasks to be handled without blocking server threads.

FileUploadServlet
Specifically designed to handle file upload requests.

DownloadServlet
Used to handle file download requests.
```
## 7.  How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)
```text
Nginx
A high-performance web server, particularly adept at handling high concurrency.

Tomcat
An open-source web server, specifically used for running Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP).

Jetty
An open-source web server for Java, commonly used in embedded systems and Java applications.
```
## 8.  clone this repo, and run it in you local.
### 1.  https://github.com/CTYue/springmvc5-demo
### 2.  Notice that you need to configure the Tomcat by yourself. tutorial in the slides.
### 3.  find out the APIs in controlelr and call some APIs, In slides, I also list some API.
### 4.  remeber to create a database for this project
### 5.  all details in the slides.
