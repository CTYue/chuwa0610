## Annotations Used by Entity

1. **@Entity**
   - **Usage**: Marks a class as a database table.
   - **Explanation**: This annotation is used to indicate that the class is an entity in a database. It is typically used in frameworks like Hibernate or JPA to map the class to a database table.
2. **@Table(name = "table_name")**
   - **Usage**: Specifies the table name in the database.
   - **Explanation**: Used in conjunction with @Entity to provide the specific table name that the entity will be mapped to in the database.
3. **@Id**
   - **Usage**: Marks a field as the primary key of the entity.
   - **Explanation**: This is used to designate a field as the primary key of the table in the database.
4. **@Column(name = "column_name")**
   - **Usage**: Specifies the column name in the database for a field.
   - **Explanation**: Allows specifying the exact column name in the database; if not used, the field name of the class will be used as the column name by default.
5. **@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)**
   - **Usage**: Configures the strategy for generating primary key values.
   - **Explanation**: This is often used with the @Id annotation to specify how the primary key should be generated (e.g., automatically incremented).
6. **@CreatedDate**
7. **@UpdateTimestamp**

## Annotations Used by Controller (Spring Framework)

1. **@Controller**
   - **Usage**: Marks a class as a web controller, capable of handling requests.
   - **Explanation**: This Spring MVC annotation indicates that the class will be used to handle web requests.
2. **@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, path = "/endpoint")**
   - **Usage**: Maps HTTP requests to handler methods of MVC and REST controllers.
   - **Explanation**: Used to map web requests onto specific handler functions. The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be handled.
3. **@GetMapping("/path")**
   - **Usage**: A convenient shortcut for @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET).
   - **Explanation**: This is a specialized version of @RequestMapping that acts as a shortcut for handling HTTP GET requests.
4. **@PostMapping("/path")**
   - **Usage**: A convenient shortcut for @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST).
   - **Explanation**: Similar to @GetMapping, but for HTTP POST requests.
5. **@ResponseBody**
   - **Usage**: Indicates that the return type should be written straight to the HTTP response body (and not placed in a Model, or interpreted as a view name).
   - **Explanation**: Often used in RESTful web services, this annotation tells a controller that the object returned is automatically serialized into JSON and passed back into the HttpResponse object.

## Annotations Used in Service Layers

1. **@Service**
   - **Usage**: Marks a class as a service provider.
   - **Explanation**: Denotes a class that performs service tasks, often something like business logic or call to persistence layer.
2. **@Component**
   - **Usage**: Generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
   - **Explanation**: Indicates that a class is a Spring component. This annotation is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component. `@Repository`, `@Service`, and `@Controller` are specializations of `@Component` for more specific use cases.
3. **@Repository**
   - **Usage**: Marks a class as a Data Access Object.
   - **Explanation**: Indicates that the class deals with data access logic.

## Annotations Used by Repositories

1. **@Query**
   - **Usage**: Used to define a custom query at the method level in a repository interface, overriding the query derivation mechanism of Spring Data.
   - **Explanation**: This annotation allows for the specification of SQL or JPQL directly on repository methods, providing a powerful way to execute complex queries that are not covered by the naming conventions of Spring Data.

## Annotations Used in Global Exception

1. **@ExceptionHandler**
   + **Usage**: Marks a method in a controller or a controller advice class to handle exceptions thrown by request-handling methods within the controller or across all controllers.
   + **Explanation**: This annotation allows specific methods to handle exceptions of certain types. When used in conjunction with `@ControllerAdvice`, it can handle exceptions globally across all controllers.
2. **@ControllerAdvice**
   - **Usage**: Declares a class that can contain global exception handlers, model attribute methods, and binder initializers.
   - **Explanation**: This annotation enhances controllers by allowing you to apply common behavior across multiple controllers. It can be used to handle exceptions, bind input parameters, or add common model attributes to models before a controller action is invoked.

## Annotations Used in Validation

1. **@Valid**
   + **Usage**: Used to specify that a particular property, method parameter, or method return type should be validated, enforcing constraints provided by other validation annotations.
   + **Explanation**: This annotation is part of the Java Bean Validation (JSR 380) API. It is used on fields or method parameters to indicate that they should be checked for validity according to constraints defined on the field or object, such as `@NotEmpty`, `@Size`, etc.

2. **@NotEmpty**
   - **Usage**: Used to assert that the annotated string, collection, map, or array is not null or empty.
   - **Explanation**: Often used in model validation to ensure that the fields which are required are not submitted as empty. This is particularly useful in form submission scenarios in web applications.

3. **@Size**
   - **Usage**: Specifies that a character sequence, collection, map, or array's size must be within the defined boundaries.
   - **Explanation**: Can be used on a string to check if its length is within the specified min and max, or on collections to check their sizes. This provides a built-in way to ensure values meet specific size constraints directly in the data model.

## Annotations Used in Configuration

1. **@Configuration**
   - **Usage**: Indicates that a class declares one or more `@Bean` methods and may be processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime.
   - **Explanation**: Part of Spring Frameworkâ€™s Java-based configuration mechanism. This annotation allows developers to write configuration classes that create and configure Spring beans.

2. **@Bean**
   - **Usage**: Used at the method level; it indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container.
   - **Explanation**: Within a class annotated with `@Configuration`, a method annotated with `@Bean` will get executed and its return value will be registered as a bean within a Spring application context. This allows for explicit declaration and configuration of Spring-managed beans.

## General Annotations

1. **@Override**
   - **Usage**: Indicates that a method overrides a method in a superclass.
   - **Explanation**: Ensures that the subclass method correctly overrides a method in its superclass.
2. **@Autowired**
   - **Usage**: Marks a constructor, field, setter method, or config method as to be autowired by Spring's dependency injection facilities.
   - **Explanation**: This annotation is used to auto-inject bean on the setter method, constructor, a property, or methods.
