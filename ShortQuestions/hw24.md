1. Read:https://www.interviewbit.com/multithreading-interview-questions/#class-level-lock-vs-object-level-lock
2. Write a thread-safe singleton class
    ```java
    public class Singleton {
        private Singleton() {}
    
        private static class SingletonHelper {
            private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();
        }
    
        public static Singleton getInstance() {
            return SingletonHelper.INSTANCE;
        }
    }
    ```
3. How to create a new thread (Please also consider Thread Pool approach)?
    * Extending the Thread Class
    ```java
       public class MyThread extends Thread {
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Thread is running");
            }
        
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                thread.start(new MyThread());
            }
       }
   ```
    * Implements Runnable
   ```java
   public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Thread is running");
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            MyRunnable runnable = new MyRunnable();
            Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
            thread.start();
        }
    }
    ```
    * Implements Callable
   ```java
   // The Callable interface is similar to Runnable, but it can return a result and throw a checked exception.
    public class MyCallable implements Callable<String> {
        public String call() throws Exception {
            return "Callable result";
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
            MyCallable callable = new MyCallable();
            Future<String> future = executor.submit(callable);

            try {
                String result = future.get();
                System.out.println(result);
            } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            } finally {
                executor.shutdown();
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    * Using a Thread Pool
   ```java
    public class ThreadPoolExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5); // Pool with 5 threads

            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                Runnable worker = new WorkerThread("" + i);
                executor.execute(worker);
            }
            executor.shutdown();
            while (!executor.isTerminated()) {
            }
            System.out.println("Finished all threads");
        }
    }

    class WorkerThread implements Runnable {
        private String command;

        public WorkerThread(String s) {
            this.command = s;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            processCommand();
        }

        private void processCommand() { 
            try {
                Thread.sleep(5000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    ```
4. Difference between Runnable and Callable?
   * runnable has no return;
   * callable has return;
5. What is the difference between t.start() and t.run()?
    * t.start starts a new thread to excute the task(run())
    * t.run() excute the task in the current thread.
6. Which way of creating threads is better:Thread class or Runnable interface?
   Runnable interface. It Separates the task from the mechanism of how the thread runs. This makes your code more modular and easier to manage. You can define the task in a class that implements Runnable and then use it with any Thread instance.
7. What are the thread statuses?
   * NEW: A thread that has been created but not yet started.
   * RUNNABLE:  thread that is ready to run and is waiting for CPU time. This state includes threads that are running as well as those waiting for CPU time.
   * BLOCKED: A thread that is blocked waiting for a monitor lock.
   * WAITING: A thread that is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action.
   * TIMED_WAITING: A thread that is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time.
   * TERMINATED: A thread that has exited.
8. Demonstrate deadlock and how to resolve it in Java code.
   Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources they need, causing them to be stuck indefinitely.
    **To prevent:**
   * Timeouts: Use timeouts to avoid waiting indefinitely.
   * Lock Ordering: Ensure a global order of acquiring locks.
   * Deadlock Detection: Use algorithms to detect deadlocks (more complex).
   * TryLock: Use ReentrantLock.tryLock() which tries to acquire the lock and fails immediately if the lock is not available.
9. How do threads communicate each other?
   * wait(), notify(), and notifyAll()
    ```java
    import java.util.LinkedList;import java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList;
    class TaskQueue { 
        private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
        private final Condition condition = lock.newCondition();
        private Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        private CopyOnWriteArrayList<String> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
    
        public voif addTask(String s) {
            lock.lock();
            try {
                queue.add(s);
                condition.signalAll();
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();
            }
        }
        public string getTask() {
            lock.lock();
        }
        try {
            while (queue.isEmpty()) {
            condition.await();
            }
            return queue.remove();
        } finally {
        lock.unlock();
     }
   }
    ```
10. Whatâ€™s the difference between class lock and object lock?
    |  | object lock | class lock |
    |----|----|----|
    | Scope | Each instance of a class has its own lock. |  There is a single lock for the entire class, shared across all instances. |
    | Synchronization Context | Used to synchronize instance methods and instance code blocks. The lock is on the instance (this). | sed to synchronize static methods and static code blocks. The lock is on the Class object (ClassName.class). |
    | Concurrency Control | Ensures that synchronized instance methods or blocks are accessed by only one thread per object instance at a time. | Ensures that synchronized static methods or blocks are accessed by only one thread per class at a time, affecting all instances of the class. |
    ```java
    public class LockExample {
        // Instance method synchronized on the object lock
        public synchronized void instanceMethod() {
            System.out.println("Instance method start: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate work
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            System.out.println("Instance method end: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
    
        // Static method synchronized on the class lock
        public static synchronized void staticMethod() {
            System.out.println("Static method start: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate work
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            System.out.println("Static method end: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            LockExample instance1 = new LockExample();
            LockExample instance2 = new LockExample();
    
            // Different object instances - object locks don't interfere
            Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> instance1.instanceMethod());
            Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> instance2.instanceMethod());
    
            // Class lock - affects all instances
            Thread t3 = new Thread(LockExample::staticMethod);
            Thread t4 = new Thread(LockExample::staticMethod);
    
            t1.start();
            t2.start();
            t3.start();
            t4.start();
        }
    }
    ```
11. What is join() method?
    The join() method is a key component of thread management that allows one thread to wait for the completion of another thread.
12. what is yield() method?
    The yield() method is a static method of the Thread class that allows a thread to voluntarily relinquish the CPU, giving other threads a chance to execute.
13. What is ThreadPool? How many types of ThreadPool? What is the TaskQueue in ThreadPool?
    A ThreadPool is a pool of worker threads that are managed by the Java runtime or a framework to efficiently execute tasks concurrently. Instead of creating a new thread for each task, a ThreadPool reuses existing threads to execute multiple tasks over time. This improves performance by reducing thread creation overhead and by managing the number of concurrent threads more efficiently.
    * FixedThreadPool:
    - A ThreadPool with a fixed number of threads.
    - Threads are pre-created and reused until the ThreadPool is shut down.
    - Useful when you have a known number of tasks and want to limit concurrent execution.
    * CachedThreadPool:
      - A ThreadPool that dynamically adjusts its size based on the workload.
      - Creates new threads as needed, reuses idle threads, and removes threads that have been idle for a certain period.
      - Suitable for applications with unpredictable or bursty workloads.
    * ScheduledThreadPool:
      - A ThreadPool that supports scheduling of tasks to execute after a delay or periodically.
      - Combines ThreadPool functionality with a scheduling mechanism.
      - Useful for executing tasks at regular intervals or with a delay.
    * SingleThreadPool:
      - A ThreadPool with only one thread.
      - Tasks are executed sequentially, ensuring thread safety and preserving task order.
      - Useful for tasks that must be executed in a specific sequence or in a single-threaded context.
14. Which Library is used to create ThreadPool? Which Interface provide main functions of thread-pool?
    * the `java.util.concurrent` package provides classes and interfaces to create and manage ThreadPools.
    * the `ExecutorService` interface provides the core functionality for creating and managing ThreadPools.
15. How to submit a task to ThreadPool?
    `executor.submit(...)`
    ```java
    public class ThreadPoolExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Create a fixed-size ThreadPool with 3 threads
            ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
    
            // Submit tasks to the ThreadPool
            for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                final int taskId = i;
                executor.submit(() -> {
                    System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " is running on thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate task execution time
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                });
            }
    
            // Shutdown the ThreadPool after all tasks are submitted
            executor.shutdown();
        }
    }
    ```
16. What is the advantage of ThreadPool?
    * Handle each incoming request by submitting them as tasks to the ThreadPool.
    * Ensure that the number of active threads does not exceed a predefined limit, preventing server overload.
    * Manage resources efficiently by reusing threads and adjusting ThreadPool size dynamically based on traffic patterns.
17. Difference between shutdown() and shutdownNow() methods of executor
    * The shutdown() method is used to initiate an orderly shutdown of the ThreadPool. It allows previously submitted tasks to execute before shutting down, but it does not accept any new tasks after being called.
    * The shutdownNow() method attempts to stop all actively executing tasks and halts the processing of waiting tasks. It does this by interrupting all threads in the ThreadPool.
    * Use shutdown() if you want to process all ongoing requests before stopping the server, ensuring no request is abruptly terminated.
      Use shutdownNow() if there's a need to abort processing and quickly release resources, such as when the server needs to shut down rapidly or handle an emergency situation.
18. What is Atomic classes? How many types of Atomic classes? Give me some code example of Atomic classes and its main methods. when to use it?
    Atomic classes provide lock-free thread-safe operations on single variables.
    Types of Atomic Classes:
AtomicBoolean: Provides atomic operations on a boolean variable.
AtomicInteger: Provides atomic operations on an integer variable.
AtomicLong: Provides atomic operations on a long variable.
AtomicReference: Provides atomic operations on a generic reference variable.
AtomicIntegerArray: Provides atomic operations on an array of integers.
AtomicLongArray: Provides atomic operations on an array of longs.
AtomicReferenceArray: Provides atomic operations on an array of generic references.

    ```java
    import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;
    
    public class AtomicExample {
        private static AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(1);
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println(atomicInteger.getAndIncrement());
            System.out.println(atomicInteger.get());//count
        }
    }
    ```
19. What is the concurrent collections? Can you list some concurrent data structure (Thread-safe)
    Concurrent collections are specialized data structures that provide thread-safe operations for managing and manipulating data in concurrent programming scenarios.
    | interface | non-thread-safe | thread-safe |
    | List | ArrayList | CopyOnWriteArrayList |
    | Map | HashMap | ConcurrentHashMap |
    | Set | HashSet | CopyOnWriteArraySet |
    | Queue | ArrayDeque/LinkedList | ArrayBlockingQueue/LinkedBlockingQueue |
    | Deque | ArrayDeque/LinkedList | LinkedBlockingDeque |
20. What kind of locks do you know? What is the advantage of each lock?
    * Synchronized Blocks and Methods : 
        Advantages:
        Simple to Use: Easy to implement and understand.
        Intrinsic Locks: Utilizes Java's built-in intrinsic lock (or monitor lock).
        Mutual Exclusion: Ensures only one thread can execute the synchronized block or method at a time.
        Visibility: Guarantees visibility of shared data changes across threads.
    * ReentrantLock
        Advantages:
        Explicit Control: Provides explicit locking and unlocking mechanisms, giving more flexibility and control compared to intrinsic locks.
        Interruptible Locking: Supports interruption of threads waiting for the lock.
        Condition Support: Allows the use of Condition objects for advanced thread signaling.
        When to Use: Useful when finer-grained control over locking is required, such as implementing custom locking protocols or using conditions for thread communication.
    * ReadWriteLock (ReentrantReadWriteLock)
        Advantages:
        Separate Read and Write Locks: Allows multiple threads to read concurrently unless a thread holds the write lock.
        Improved Throughput: Can significantly improve throughput in scenarios where reads are more frequent than writes.
        When to Use: Ideal when there are more reads than writes on shared data, improving performance by allowing concurrent reads while ensuring exclusive access during writes.
    * StampedLock
        Advantages:
        Optimistic Locking: Supports optimistic read locking, which can be useful when reads vastly outnumber writes.
        Upgradeable Locking: Allows threads to upgrade a read lock to a write lock without releasing the lock first.
        When to Use: Suitable for scenarios where reads are frequent and writes are infrequent, and when optimistic locking can improve throughput by reducing contention.
21. What is future and completableFuture? List some main methods of ComplertableFuture.
    Future: Represents the result of an asynchronous computation. It provides methods to check if the computation is complete, retrieve the result, and cancel the computation if desired. However, it lacks mechanisms for explicitly completing or handling errors in the computation.
    CompletableFuture: Extends Future and provides a more flexible and powerful way to express asynchronous computations. It allows chaining of dependent computations, handling exceptions, and explicitly completing a future with a result or an exception.
    ```java
    /**Asynchronous Execution:
    runAsync(Runnable runnable): Returns a new CompletableFuture that is asynchronously completed by a task running in the ForkJoinPool.commonPool() after it runs the given action.
    supplyAsync(Supplier<U> supplier): Returns a new CompletableFuture that is asynchronously completed by a task running in the ForkJoinPool.commonPool() with the value obtained by calling the given Supplier.**/
    public class CompletableFutureExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
            // Create a CompletableFuture
            CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
                return "Hello";
            });

            // Define a completion stage
            CompletableFuture<String> thenFuture = future.thenApply(result -> {
                return result + " World";
            });

            // Get the result
            String result = thenFuture.get();
            System.out.println(result); // Output: Hello World
        }
    }
    ```
22. Type the code by your self and try to understand it. (package com.chuwa.tutorial.t08_multithreading)
23. Write a code to create 2 threads, one thread print 1,3,5,7,9, another thread print 2,4,6,8,10. (solution is in com.chuwa.tutorial.t08_multithreading.c05_waitNotify.OddEventPrinter)
    ```java
    public class PrintNumbers {
        private static final Object lock = new Object();
        private static int number = 1;
        private static final int MAX_NUM = 10;
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thread oddThread = new Thread(() -> {
                synchronized (lock) {
                    while (number <= MAX_NUM) {
                        if (number % 2 != 0) {
                            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": " + number);
                            number++;
                            lock.notify(); // Notify the even thread
                        } else {
                            try {
                                lock.wait(); // Wait for notification from even thread
                            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                                e.printStackTrace();
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }, "OddThread");
    
            Thread evenThread = new Thread(() -> {
                synchronized (lock) {
                    while (number <= MAX_NUM) {
                        if (number % 2 == 0) {
                            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": " + number);
                            number++;
                            lock.notify(); // Notify the odd thread
                        } else {
                            try {
                                lock.wait(); // Wait for notification from odd thread
                            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                                e.printStackTrace();
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }, "EvenThread");
    
            oddThread.start();
            evenThread.start();
        }
    }
    ```
24. One solution use synchronized and wait notify
25. One solution use ReentrantLock and await,signal
    ```java
    import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition;
    import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
    
    public class PrintNumbers {
        private static final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
        private static final Condition oddCondition = lock.newCondition();
        private static final Condition evenCondition = lock.newCondition();
        private static int number = 1;
        private static final int MAX_NUM = 10;
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thread oddThread = new Thread(() -> {
                while (number <= MAX_NUM) {
                    lock.lock();
                    try {
                        if (number % 2 != 0) {
                            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": " + number);
                            number++;
                            evenCondition.signal(); // Signal the even thread to wake up
                        } else {
                            try {
                                oddCondition.await(); // Wait for the signal from the even thread
                            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                                e.printStackTrace();
                            }
                        }
                    } finally {
                        lock.unlock();
