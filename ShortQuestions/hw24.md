2. Write a Thread-Safe Singleton Class
```java
public class ThreadSafeSingleton {
    private static volatile ThreadSafeSingleton instance;
    private ThreadSafeSingleton() {
        // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }
    public static ThreadSafeSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (ThreadSafeSingleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
3. How to Create a New Thread (Including Thread Pool Approach)
a) Extending the Thread Class:
b) Implementing the Runnable Interface:
c) Thread Pool Approach:

4. Difference Between Runnable and Callable:
Runnable:
Defines a single method, run() without a return type.
Used for tasks that don't need to return a result.
Callable:
Extends Runnable and defines a single method, call() with a return type.
Used for tasks that need to return a value upon completion.
Can throw checked exceptions.

5. Difference Between t.start() and t.run():
t.start():
Marks the thread object as ready to run (Runnable state).
The thread scheduler assigns it resources and places it in the execution queue.
The thread's run() method is invoked by the JVM in a separate thread of execution.
t.run():
Directly executes the run() method in the calling thread.
It's not generally recommended for thread creation as it defeats the purpose of creating a separate thread for concurrent execution.

6. Thread vs. Runnable:
Thread Class:
Provides a class hierarchy for managing threads (lifecycle, priority, state, etc.).
Use for tasks that benefit from thread-specific methods or state management.
Less flexible due to direct subclassing.
Runnable Interface:
Represents the task to be executed by a thread.
More modular and promotes separation of concerns.
Allows the same Runnable object to be used by multiple threads.

7. Thread Statuses:
NEW: Thread object created, not yet started.
RUNNABLE: Thread is ready to run and waiting for resources from the scheduler.
RUNNING: Thread is actively executing code.
WAITING: Thread is suspended due to waiting for an external event (e.g., I/O, resource lock).
TIMED_WAITING: Same as WAITING, but with a specified timeout.

8. Demondtrate deadlock and how to resolve it in Java code.
Acquire locks in a consistent order: Always acquire locks in the same order across all threads to avoid circular dependencies.
Use timeouts: Set timeouts when acquiring locks to prevent indefinite blocking.
Avoid nested locking: Minimize nesting of synchronized blocks to reduce the chance of deadlocks.

9.  How do threads communicate each other?
Shared memory: Threads can read and write to shared variables, but proper synchronization is crucial.
Wait-notify mechanism: Threads can wait on a condition and be notified by another thread when the condition becomes true.
Concurrent collections: Java provides thread-safe collections (e.g., BlockingQueue, ConcurrentHashMap) for safe access from multiple threads.
Atomic classes: Classes like AtomicInteger offer thread-safe operations on primitive data types.
Executors and Callables: ExecutorService helps manage threads, and Callable allows threads to return results

10.  What's the difference between class lock and object lock?
Class Lock (Static Lock): A lock associated with the class itself. Only one thread can acquire the class lock at a time, effectively serializing access to all static members and synchronized methods of the class.
Object Lock: A lock associated with an instance of the class. Multiple instances can have separate locks, allowing concurrent access to non-static members and synchronized methods of different objects.

11.  What is join() method?
Waits for a thread to finish execution before continuing in the calling thread.
Useful for ensuring completion of tasks started in child threads before proceeding in the main thread.

12.  what is yield() method
Suggests to the JVM that the current thread might be willing to yield the CPU to another thread of the same priority.
Not a guaranteed yield, as the decision ultimately rests with the scheduler.
Use sparingly, as excessive yielding can lead to performance overhead.

13.  What is ThreadPool? How many types of ThreadPool? What is the TaskQueue in ThreadPool?
Improves performance and resource management compared to manually creating and starting threads.

Fixed-size thread pool: A pool with a fixed number of threads.
Cached thread pool: Creates and destroys threads as needed (up to a maximum size).
Scheduled thread pool: Schedules tasks to run after a delay or periodically.
Single-threaded executor: A pool with a single thread for serial execution.

14.  Which Library is used to create ThreadPool? Which Interface provide main functions of thread-pool?
Library: Thread pools are part of the java.util.concurrent package.
Interface: The ExecutorService interface provides the main methods for creating and managing thread pools.

15.  How to submit a task to ThreadPool?
Use the submit() or execute() methods of an ExecutorService instance:

16.  What is the advantage of ThreadPool?
Performance: Reusing threads saves time and resources compared to creating and destroying them for each task.
Resource Management: Limits the number of concurrently executing threads, preventing resource exhaustion.
Task Queuing: Tasks are queued and executed in order as threads become available.
Shutdown: Allows graceful shutdown of the pool, waiting for running tasks to finish before termination.

17.  Difference between shutdown() and shutdownNow() methods of executor
shutdown():
Initiates an orderly shutdown.
Existing tasks in the queue are processed, but no new tasks are accepted.
Once all pending tasks are complete, the pool terminates.
shutdownNow():
Attempts to stop all running and queued tasks immediately.
May lead to unexpected behavior if tasks are interrupted.
Returns a list of tasks that were not completed or were unable to be stopped.

18.  What is Atomic classes? How many types of Atomic classes? Give me some code example of Atomic classes and its main methods. when to use it?
Provide thread-safe operations on primitive data types.
Useful for concurrent access to shared variables without explicit synchronization mechanisms like locks.

19.  What is the concurrent collections? Can you list some concurrent data structure (Thread-safe)
Thread-safe collections designed for concurrent access from multiple threads.
Common Concurrent Data Structures:
BlockingQueue: FIFO queue, blocks when attempting to add to a full queue or remove from an empty queue.
ConcurrentHashMap: Thread-safe hash map for efficient key-value lookups.
ConcurrentLinkedQueue: Concurrent queue based on a linked list for fast insertion and removal.
CopyOnWriteArrayList: Thread-safe list implementation that creates a copy for modification.

20.  What kind of locks do you know? What is the advantage of each lock?
Reentrant Lock: Can be acquired multiple times by the same thread.
Synchronized Blocks and Methods: Convenient for short critical sections, implicitly uses a reentrant lock.
ReadWriteLock: Allows concurrent read access but exclusive write access.
Semaphores: Control access to a limited number of resources.
StampedLock: An optimistic locking mechanism that avoids overhead when there's no contention.

21.  What is future and completableFuture? List some main methods of ComplertableFuture.
Future: Represents the eventual result of a task submitted to an ExecutorService. Allows checking for completion and retrieving the result.
Main Methods of CompletableFuture:

get(): Waits for the task to complete and returns the result.
isDone(): Checks if the task has finished.
thenApply(), thenAccept(), thenCompose(): Specify actions to be performed upon successful completion.
exceptionally(): Handle exceptions that occur during the task execution.
CompletableFuture Advantages:

Allows chaining of asynchronous tasks.
Provides a mechanism for handling exceptions in asynchronous operations.
