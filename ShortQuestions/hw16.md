2. What is Selenium?

Selenium is an open-source tool used for automating web browsers. It provides a suite of tools for automating web applications for testing purposes but is not limited to just that. It supports multiple programming languages such as Java, C#, and Python. Selenium can be used for functional testing, performance testing, and regression testing.

3. What is Cucumber?

Cucumber is a testing tool that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It allows developers to write tests in plain language (Gherkin), which can be understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. The tests are written in a feature file and are mapped to code that executes the test scenarios.

4. What is JMeter?

JMeter is an open-source tool used for performance and load testing. It is designed to measure the performance and load of web applications, but it can also be used to test other services such as databases, FTP servers, and web services. JMeter provides a graphical interface for designing test plans and analyzing test results.

5. What is the lifecycle of JUnit?

- The lifecycle of a JUnit test includes the following phases:
  1. **Setup**: Methods annotated with `@BeforeAll` and `@BeforeEach` run before the test methods.
  2. **Execution**: Methods annotated with `@Test` contain the test logic and are executed.
  3. **Teardown**: Methods annotated with `@AfterEach` and `@AfterAll` run after the test methods.

6. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level (static)?

   Yes, methods annotated with `@BeforeAll` must be static because they are run once before any test methods in the class.

7. What is Mockito? and what are its limitations? what kind of tools can help?

- Mockito is a popular open-source Java framework used for creating mock objects in unit tests. It allows developers to simulate the behavior of real objects to isolate the code being tested.

**Limitations:**

- Cannot mock static methods or constructors directly.
- Limited support for mocking final classes and methods.
- Difficulty in mocking complex dependencies or legacy code.

**Tools that can help:**
- **PowerMock**: Extends Mockito to mock static methods and constructors.
- **JMockit**: Provides more advanced mocking capabilities, including static methods.

8. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?

- `@Mock` is used to create and inject mock objects.
- `@InjectMocks` is used to inject mock objects into the class being tested, enabling the creation of the class's dependencies.

9. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?

- `@Mock` is used to create and inject mock objects.
- `@InjectMocks` is used to inject mock objects into the class being tested, enabling the creation of the class's dependencies.

10. What is Mockito ArgumentMatchers?

- Mockito `ArgumentMatchers` are used to define flexible arguments for mock methods. They allow the specification of argument constraints for methods to match any value or specific conditions.

11. What is Hamcrest Matchers?

- Hamcrest Matchers are a set of matchers used in unit testing to create flexible and readable assertions. They allow developers to write assertions in a more expressive and natural language.

12. Do you know @Spy? What is the difference between @Spy and @Mock?

- `@Spy` allows the creation of partial mocks, where real methods are called except for those that are stubbed. `@Mock` creates a full mock, where all methods are stubbed.

13. What is assertion?

- Assertion is a statement in unit testing that checks if a condition is true. If the condition is false, the test fails, indicating a problem in the code.

14. If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of test?

- When developing a new feature, the following types of tests are typically written:
  1. **Unit Tests**: To test individual components or methods in isolation.
  1. **Integration Tests**: To test interactions between different components or services.
  1. **Functional Tests**: To test the feature's functionality from an end-user perspective.
  1. **Performance Tests**: To test the performance and scalability of the feature.
