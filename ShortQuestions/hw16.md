**2. Compare let vs var with your own code examples.**

let is block scope, var is global/function scope. the variable defined by let only accessible in block, in blew example the first for loop will print 1, 2,3,4,5,6,7â€¦10

the second scope will print 10, 10, 10..

```java
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}
```

**5. Explain Event Loop, Macrotask, and Microtask with code samples.**

Event loop is used to handle asynchronized operations. When the code executed, the synchronized code would be push into call stack, the asynchronized operations will be registered and push into task queue. The event loop will move the code in task queue when call stack is empty.

Javascript has MacroTask queue and MicroTask queue. When browser meet <script>, the code inside of script will be teat as a macroTask, if the code has setTimeout,setInterval etc, it will be registered as MacroTask, MacroTask will be add into MacroTask queue. If the code has promise etc, it will be registered as microTask and add into microTask queue. Event loop will move the code in task queue into call stack and execute it.
