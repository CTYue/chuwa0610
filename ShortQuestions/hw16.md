2. what is selenium? 

   >Selenium is *a free (open-source) automated testing framework used to validate web* applications across different browsers and platforms.

3. what is cucumber? 

   >Cucumber is *a tool that supports Behaviour-Driven Development(BDD*).

4. what is JMeter? 

   >The Apache JMeterâ„¢ application is *open source software, a 100% pure Java application designed to load test functional behavior and* measure performance. 

5. What is the lifecircle of Junit?

6. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)? 

   >Yes

7. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations? what kind of tools can give help? 

   >Mockito is a popular Java mocking framework used for writing unit tests in Java programming. It allows developers to create mock objects in test cases to simulate the behavior of real objects.
   >
   >a) It cannot mock constructors, private methods, static methods, and final classes. 
   >
   >b) It requires Java version 6 plus to run.
   >
   >c) It also cannot mock equals(), hashCode() methods.
   >
   >PowerMock

8. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks? 

   >`@Mock` is an annotation from the Mockito framework that is used to create and inject mocked instances. It replaces the actual implementation of a class with a dummy version that allows the developer to control the outputs of certain functions for testing purposes. 
   >
   >`@InjectMocks` is used to create an instance of a class and inject mocks created with `@Mock` or `@Spy` annotations into it. This annotation simplifies the setup of tests by automatically injecting required dependencies as mocks. This is particularly useful when the class under test has multiple dependencies, and you want to focus on testing its behavior rather than dealing with the overhead of setting up each dependency manually.

9. What is the stubbing (define behaviors)? 

   >Stubbing in the context of software testing is a technique used primarily in unit testing to simulate the behaviors of software components that a unit under test interacts with. By defining stubs, developers can isolate the unit being tested from its external dependencies. This allows for more controlled and predictable testing environments where specific behaviors and data can be scripted.

10. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers 

    >`ArgumentMatchers` are used to:
    >
    >- **Generalize method stubbing**: Allow stubbed methods to return specific outputs regardless of the exact input, as long as the input matches certain conditions.
    >- **Verify method calls**: Check that methods are called with the right type of arguments, even if you don't know beforehand what the exact values will be.

11. what is Hamcrest Matchers 

    >Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects, allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively. This tool is widely used in testing to provide more readable assertions. It is not tied to a specific test framework, which makes Hamcrest matchers highly reusable across different types of testing libraries such as JUnit and TestNG.

12. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock? 

    >@spy is special case of @Mock. 
    >
    >Mock objects replace real objects and simulate behavior, verifying interactions between objects in unit tests. Spy objects are real objects with instrumentation to track method calls, retaining original behavior while observing interactions.

13. What is assertion? 

    >An assertion is **a statement in the Java programming language that enables you to test your assumptions about your program**.

14. If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of tests? 

    >Peer Test
    >
    >Unit Test: Verify the correctness of individual components
    >
    >Integration Testing: Verify that the collaboration between components or modules is correct
    >
    >Automation Test
    >
    >Regression Test: Ensure that after changes, existing functionality is still correct
    >
    >Performance Test: Verify the performance and efficiency of the system
    >
    >Stress Testing: Ensure that the system can still work normally under high pressure
    >
    >User Acceptance Testing: Ensure that the software meets user needs and expectations
    >
    >A/B Test
    >
    >Alpha/Beta Test

15. Add unit test for CommentServiceImpl, the coverage should be 100%. 

16. write Integration tests for PostController. The tests should cover all scenarios.
