## 2.  what is selenium?
* An open-source framework used for web browsers testing

## 3.  what is cucumber?
* Cucumber is a software tool that supports behavior-driven development (BDD). Central to the Cucumber BDD approach is its ordinary language parser called Gherkin. It allows expected software behaviors to be specified in a logical language that customers can understand. 

## 4.  what is JMeter?
* The Apache JMeter application is open source software, a 100% pure Java application designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance.

## 5.  What is the lifecircle of Junit?
1. Class Level Setup (@BeforeAll)
2. Setup (@BeforeEach)
3. Test Execution (@Test)
4. Cleanup (@AfterEach)
5. Class Level Cleanup (@AfterAll)

## 6.  Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
* Yes

## 7.  What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?  what kind of tools can give help?
* Mockito is a popular Java-based mocking framework used for unit testing
* does not support mocking static, final Classes and Methods
* PowerMockito

## 8.  What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
* @Mock annotation is used to create and inject mock objects
* The @InjectMocks annotation is used to automatically inject mock fields into the object being tested. 

## 9.  What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?
* allows you to specify what a mock object should do when a particular method is called

## 10.  what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers
* ArgumentMatchers are used to specify flexible criteria for arguments passed to mocked methods. This allows for more dynamic and flexible stubbing and verification by matching arguments using conditions rather than exact values.

## 11.  what is Hamcrest Matchers
* Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects, allowing for more readable and expressive assertions in tests. 

## 12.  do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
* Both @Spy and @Mock are used to create mock objects in Mockito
* The @Spy annotation is used to create a spy object. A spy is a partial mock: it wraps an existing instance of a class and allows you to stub some methods while using the real implementation for others. Unlike mocks, spies maintain the state and behavior of the real object and only override specific methods as needed.

## 13.  What is assertion?
* An assertion is a statement used in programming to verify that a condition holds true. 

## 14.  If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of tests?
* Unit Test: test individual units
* Integration Tests: test the interaction between different modules or services
* Functional Tests: To test the feature's functionality from the end-user's perspective
* End-to-End Tests: test the entire application flow from start to finish

## 15.  Add unit test for CommentServiceImpl, the coverage should be 100%.

## 16.  write Integration tests for PostController. The tests should cover all scenarios.
