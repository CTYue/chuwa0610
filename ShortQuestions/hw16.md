## 2. what is selenium?
Selenium is a popular open-source tool suite for automating web browsers. It is primarily used for automating web applications for testing purposes, but it can also be used for web scraping and automating repetitive tasks on web pages.

## 3. what is cucumber?
Cucumber is a popular tool for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), which allows developers, testers, and business stakeholders to define application behavior using plain language. Cucumber supports writing test cases in a natural, readable language (usually Gherkin) that non-programmers can understand. When integrated with Spring, Cucumber helps to automate the testing of Spring applications by combining the benefits of BDD with Spring's powerful testing capabilities.

## 4. what is JMeter?
Apache JMeter is an open-source tool designed for performance testing and load testing of web applications. It is primarily used to measure and analyze the performance of web applications and a variety of services, such as databases, web services, FTP servers, and more. JMeter simulates multiple users accessing a web service to determine how well it performs under different load conditions.  
Key Features of JMeter
1. Open Source: JMeter is free to use and is actively maintained by the Apache Software Foundation.
2. Platform Independent: Written in Java, JMeter runs on any operating system that supports Java.
3. GUI and Command Line: Provides a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) as well as command-line options for headless operation.
4. Protocol Support: Supports various protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, JDBC, JMS, SOAP, REST, and more.
5. Extensible: Can be extended with plugins to add new functionalities or enhance existing ones.
6. Recording Capabilities: Can record user interactions with a web application to create test plans automatically.
7. Distributed Testing: Supports distributed testing by allowing multiple JMeter instances to run tests in parallel, distributing the load among several machines.
8. Test Result Analysis: Provides detailed reporting and visualization tools to analyze test results.

## 5. What is the lifecircle of Junit?
### JUnit 4
1. `@BeforeClass`: This annotation is used on a public static void method that needs to be run once before any of the test methods in the class. It is typically used to perform expensive setup operations that only need to be done once.

2. `@Before`: This annotation is used on a public void method that needs to be run before each test method. It is typically used to set up test data or initialize objects.

3. `@Test`: This annotation is used on public void methods that represent the actual test cases. JUnit will run each method annotated with @Test.

4. `@After`: This annotation is used on a public void method that needs to be run after each test method. It is typically used to clean up test data or reset objects to their initial state.

5. `@AfterClass`: This annotation is used on a public static void method that needs to be run once after all the test methods in the class have been run. It is typically used to perform cleanup operations that only need to be done once.
   ```
   import org.junit.After;
   import org.junit.AfterClass;
   import org.junit.Before;
   import org.junit.BeforeClass;
   import org.junit.Test;

   public class JUnit4Test {

      @BeforeClass
      public static void setUpBeforeClass() throws Exception {
         // Code executed once before all tests
         System.out.println("BeforeClass: Setup before all tests");
      }

      @Before
      public void setUp() throws Exception {
         // Code executed before each test
         System.out.println("Before: Setup before each test");
      }

      @Test
      public void test1() {
         // Actual test code
         System.out.println("Test 1: Executing test1");
      }

      @Test
      public void test2() {
         // Actual test code
         System.out.println("Test 2: Executing test2");
      }

      @After
      public void tearDown() throws Exception {
         // Code executed after each test
         System.out.println("After: Cleanup after each test");
      }

      @AfterClass
      public static void tearDownAfterClass() throws Exception {
         // Code executed once after all tests
         System.out.println("AfterClass: Cleanup after all tests");
      }
   }
   ```
### JUnit 5
1. `@BeforeAll`: This annotation is used on a static method that needs to be run once before all test methods in the class. Similar to @BeforeClass in JUnit 4.

2. `@BeforeEach`: This annotation is used on a method that needs to be run before each test method. Similar to @Before in JUnit 4.

3. `@Test`: This annotation is used on methods that represent the actual test cases. Similar to @Test in JUnit 4.

4. `@AfterEach`: This annotation is used on a method that needs to be run after each test method. Similar to @After in JUnit 4.

5. `@AfterAll`: This annotation is used on a static method that needs to be run once after all test methods in the class have been run. Similar to @AfterClass in JUnit 4.

6. `@DisplayName`: This annotation is used to provide a custom name for the test method, making the test output more readable.
   ```
   import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll;
   import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterEach;
   import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll;
   import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
   import org.junit.jupiter.api.DisplayName;
   import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

   public class JUnit5Test {

      @BeforeAll
      static void setUpBeforeClass() throws Exception {
         // Code executed once before all tests
         System.out.println("BeforeAll: Setup before all tests");
      }

      @BeforeEach
      void setUp() throws Exception {
         // Code executed before each test
         System.out.println("BeforeEach: Setup before each test");
      }

      @Test
      @DisplayName("Test Case 1")
      void test1() {
         // Actual test code
         System.out.println("Test 1: Executing test1");
      }

      @Test
      @DisplayName("Test Case 2")
      void test2() {
         // Actual test code
         System.out.println("Test 2: Executing test2");
      }

      @AfterEach
      void tearDown() throws Exception {
         // Code executed after each test
         System.out.println("AfterEach: Cleanup after each test");
      }

      @AfterAll
      static void tearDownAfterClass() throws Exception {
         // Code executed once after all tests
         System.out.println("AfterAll: Cleanup after all tests");
      }
   }

   ```

## 6. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)?
Yes, `@BeforeAll` is intended to perform setup tasks that are needed once per test class, before any of the test methods are run. Making it static ensures that it is called only once, and not for every instance of the test class.  

`@BeforeAll` shoule be static because:
1. Single Execution: A static method is executed only once when the class is loaded, ensuring that the setup logic is executed a single time, regardless of how many test instances are created.
2. No Instance Dependency: Since @BeforeAll is static, it cannot rely on instance variables, ensuring that the setup logic is independent of any particular test instance state.
3. Consistent State: Having a static @BeforeAll method helps maintain a consistent state for the entire test class, avoiding potential issues that could arise from instance-specific initialization.
   ```
   public class JUnit5Test {

      @BeforeAll
      static void setUpBeforeClass() throws Exception {
         // Code executed once before all tests
         System.out.println("BeforeAll: Setup before all tests");
      }
   }
   ```

## 7. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations? what kind of tools can give help?
Mockito is a popular open-source Java library used for creating mock objects in automated unit tests. It allows developers to write tests that isolate the system under test (SUT) by mocking its dependencies, thus ensuring that tests are focused on the behavior of the SUT without being influenced by the state or behavior of external components. Mockito is part of the broader family of tools used for Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).  
Key Features of Mockito
1. Mocking: Create mock instances of classes and interfaces.
2. Stubbing: Define the behavior of methods in mock objects.
3. Verification: Verify interactions with mock objects, such as method calls and parameters.
4. Flexible: Supports both classical and mockist TDD.
5. Readable Syntax: Provides a clean, readable, and intuitive syntax for creating and managing mocks.
6. Annotation Support: Simplifies the creation of mocks using annotations like @Mock, @InjectMocks, and @Captor.

### Limitations of Mockito
1. Static Methods: Mockito does not support mocking static methods directly. This can be limiting when dealing with legacy code that relies heavily on static methods.
2. Final Classes and Methods: By default, Mockito cannot mock final classes and methods. Although this limitation can be mitigated using tools like Mockito's inline mock maker, it may still pose challenges in certain scenarios.
3. Private Methods: Mockito does not support mocking private methods. Tests should focus on public behavior, and reliance on private methods indicates a need for refactoring.
4. Constructor Injection: Mockito’s @InjectMocks annotation does not support constructor injection out of the box, which can complicate tests for classes that use constructor-based dependency injection.
5. Complex Dependencies: Mockito is best suited for unit tests. For integration tests that involve complex dependencies or interactions between multiple components, additional tools or approaches may be needed.
6. Behavioral Testing: Mockito is primarily designed for state-based testing rather than behavioral testing. It’s focused on what methods are called and with what parameters rather than the overall behavior and state transitions of the application.  
Tools that can help Mockito includes: PowerMock, Spring Test and Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers, and AssertJ.

## 8. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks?
The `@Mock` annotation is used to create and inject mock objects. It tells Mockito to mock the specified class or interface and provides a dummy implementation of its methods, which can be further configured in the test.  
```
public class MyServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private MyDependency myDependency;
}
```
The `@InjectMocks` annotation is used to automatically inject mock objects (annotated with `@Mock`) into the tested object. This helps reduce boilerplate code for setting up dependencies.
```
public class MyServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private MyDependency myDependency;

    @InjectMocks
    private MyService myService;
}
```

## 9. What is the stubbing (define behaviors)?
Stubbing is a term used in testing, particularly in the context of mocking frameworks like Mockito, to define the behavior of a mock object’s method. When you stub a method, you specify what should happen when the method is called: what value it should return, what exception it should throw, or any other action it should perform. This allows you to simulate various scenarios and test the behavior of your system under different conditions.

## 10. what is Mockito Argument Matchers?
Mockito Argument Matchers are tools provided by Mockito to specify flexible criteria for method arguments when stubbing behaviors or verifying interactions. They allow you to write more generalized tests by matching method arguments based on conditions rather than exact values. This is particularly useful when the exact argument values are not predictable or when you want to simplify your test code.

## 11. what is Hamcrest Matchers
Hamcrest is a library of matchers that can be used to create flexible and readable assertions in tests. It is widely used in Java testing frameworks like JUnit to make assertions more expressive and to provide better error messages when tests fail. Hamcrest matchers allow you to specify expectations for test outcomes in a way that is both easy to read and to write.

## 12. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock?
Differences between `@Mock` and `@Spy`
1. Object Creation:
   - `@Mock`: Creates a mock object without calling the real methods.
   - `@Spy`: Creates a real instance of the object, allowing real methods to be called.
2. Method Execution:
   - `@Mock`: Methods return default values or specified stubs.
   - `@Spy`: Real methods are executed unless explicitly stubbed.
3. Usage Scenarios:
   - `@Mock`: Use when you need to completely control the behavior of the dependency and do not require any real method execution.
   - `@Spy`: Use when you need to partially mock an object, executing some real methods while stubbing others.
4. Initialization:
   - `@Mock`: Can be used directly with @Mock annotation.
   - `@Spy`: Requires either explicit instantiation or using @Spy on an already instantiated object.

## 13. What is assertion?
Assertion is a statement used in programming, particularly in testing, to verify that a certain condition holds true at a specific point in the execution of a program. Assertions are crucial in ensuring that the code behaves as expected. They help identify bugs and errors by checking that the output or state of the program matches the expected results.

## 14. If you have developed a new feature,how many types of tests for this feature? and what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of tests?
1. Unit Testing:
   - Definition: Testing the smallest testable units of a program, such as functions or methods
   - Purpose: Verify the correctness of individual components
2. Integration Testing:
   - Definition: Testing the interactions between multiple components or modules
   - Purpose: Verify that the collaboration between components or modules is correct
3. Regression Testing:
   - Definition: After modifying the program or environment, re-run previously run tests to confirm that no new errors have been introduced
   - Purpose: Ensure that after changes, existing functionality is still correct
4. Performance Testing:
   - Definition: Testing the performance and Performance and response time of a system under a specific workload
   - Purpose: Verify the performance and efficiency of the system -> 200ms
5. Stress Testing
   - Definition: Testing the stability and reliability of a system by simulating an environment with workloads or data volumes beyond normal levels
   - Purpose: Ensure that the system can still work normally under high pressure -> 2k QPS
6. User Acceptance Testing(UAT):
   - Definition: The end user tests the software to confirm that it can perform the required tasks under actual conditions.
   - Purpose: Ensure that the software meets user needs and expectations
Tests that are written by developers include: Unit tests, Integration tests, functional tests, and regression tests.
