1. List all of the new learned annotations to your annotations.md 

2. what is selenium? 

   Selenium is a suite of tools designed for automating web browsers, primarily used for testing web applications. It enables developers and testers to create automated tests that simulate user interactions with a web application to ensure it functions correctly across different browsers and environments. 

   - Selenium is an open-source suite of tools and libraries that automates the testing of websites and web applications
   - offering many tools and libraries to automate web browser interactions.
   - mimic how users interact with browsers, and a server to manage brower usage accross different platforms

3. what is cucumber? 
   - BDD (behavior driven development)
   - It allows you to write test cases in plain language, which makes them easy to understand for non-technical stakeholders while still being executable by the testing framework.
   ```
   one example:
   Feature: Login functionality
   
     Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
     Given the user is on the login page
     When the user enters valid credentials
     Then the user should be redirected to the homepage
   ```

4. what is JMeter? 
   - JMeter is a powerful and widely-used open-source tool designed for performance testing and load testing of web applications.
   - It allows developers and testers to simulate a heavy load on a server, network, or object to test its strength or analyze overall performance under different load types.

5. What is the lifecircle of Junit? 
   - @BeforeAll
     - execute once before all tests in the test class
   - @BeforeEach
     - executed before each test method
   - @Test
     - actual test methods that contain the test logic
   - @AfterEach
     - executed after each test method
   - @AfterAll
     - executed once after all tests in the test class.

6. Is @BeforeAll method should be Class level(static)? 
   - Yes
   - @BeforeAll methods must have a void return type and must be static by default

7. What is Mockito? and what is its limitations?  what kind of tools can give help?
   - Mockito
     - Mockito is a popular open-source Java framework used for creating mock objects in unit tests.
     - Mockito simplifies the process of creating mocks, stubs, and verifying interactions, making it easier to test code in isolation

   - limitations
     - Cannot Mock Final Classes/Methods
     - Limited Static Method Mocking
     - No Mocking of Constructors:
     - Reflection Overhead:
     - Complex Interactions:
     
   - tools can help
     - PowerMock
       - Extends Mockito to support mocking of static methods, constructors, and final methods/classes.

8. What is @Mock and what is @InjectMocks? 
   - The @Mock  is used to create and inject mock instances for the annotated fields.
   - The @InjectMocks is Used to create an instance of the class under test and automatically inject all available mocks (@Mock) into it

9. What is the stubbing (define behaviors)? 
   - refers to the process of defining the behavior of a mock object when specific methods are called.
   - when(...).thenReturn(...)
   - when(...).thenThrow(...)

10. what is Mockito ArgumentMatchers 
    - is a class provides a set of methods to define flexible and complex argument matching rules for mocked method calls.
      - any()
      - antString(), anyInt()
      - eq(T value)
      - isA(Class<T> type)
      - argThat(ArgumentMatcher<T> matcher)
      - isNull() and notNull()

11. what is Hamcrest Matchers 
    - Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects, allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively.
    - Readable Assertions
      - assertThat(actualValue, is(expectedValue));
    - Flexible Matchers
      - assertThat(actualList, hasSize(3));
      - assertThat(actualString, containsString("expected substring"));
    - Composability
      - assertThat(actualValue, allOf(greaterThan(5), lessThan(10)));

12. do you know @spy? what is difference between @spy and @Mock? 
    - @Spy is used to create a spy object, which is a partial mock of a real object. 
    - @Mock, which creates a completely mock object with no real behavior
    - 
    | @Spy                                                        | @Mock                                                                      |
    |-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | partial mock, use real instance of the class                | completely mock object with no real behavior                               |
    | methods not stubbed will retain their real implementation   | all methods are stubbed by default, need to explicitly define when..then.. |
    | useful when want to maintain the real behavior of the class | useful when you need to isolate the unit under test from its dependencies  |

13. What is assertion?
    - an assertion is a statement or check that verifies whether a certain condition is true at a specific point during the execution of a test.
      - Equality Assertions
      - Inequality Assertions
      - Null Assertions
      - True/False Assertions
      - Collection Assertions
      - Exception Assertions

14. If you have developed a new feature, how many types of tests for this feature? and
     what kind of tests are written by you? what is the purpose of each type of tests? 
    - Write Unit testcase : verify the correctness of individual units of code
    - Integration test: verify that different components or systems work together correctly.

15. Add unit test for CommentServiceImpl, the coverage should be 100%.

    

16. write Integration tests for PostController. The tests should cover all scenarios.
