    | Type of Objects             | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
    |-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
    | DTO(Data Transfer Object)   | An object that carries data between processes to reduce the number of method calls. DTO does **NOT** have any behavior and business logic, except for storage, retrieval, serialization and deserialization of its own data.                                                                                           |
    | DAO(Data Access Object)     | The DataAccessObject abstracts the underlying data access implementation for the BusinessObject to enable transparent access to the data source. It provides a standardized interface to perform CRUD operations on entities. A typical DAO includes a common set of operations like find, insert, update, and delete. |
    | VO(Value Object)            | To hold immutable data. They are used to measure or describe things in the domain, and their equality is not based on identity but rather on attribute equality.                                                                                                                                                       |
    | PO(Persist Object)          | Represents data stored in a database. POs contain annotations or configurations defining their mapping to database tables. They can include business logic related to persistence. Annotations like @Entity , @Table , @Id , @Column , etc., are commonly used in PO.                                                  |
    | BO(Business Object)         | Encapsulates the core business logic and interacts with the DTO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
    | POJO(Plain Old Java Object) | Ordinary Java object, not bound by any special restriction other than those forced by Java Language Specification and not requiring any classpath.                                                                                                                                                                     |
    | Payload                     | It refers to the actual data sent in an HTTP request or response body. The payload does not include protocol or metadata, just the actual data needed for a specific operation, such as the JSON sent in a REST API call.                                                                                              |   
    | model                       | The model represents the data and the business rules that govern access to and updates of this data. A model holds the data and is represented by a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) in Java. Models can include business logic, data access logic, and validation logic. They are the heart of the business application.  |

3. What is @JsonProperty("description_yyds")
   The @JsonProperty annotation is used to serialization and deserialization of JSON. It is specifying that Jackson should map the "description_yyds" JSON property to this particular Java field or method when serializing or deserializing.

4. Explain the purpose of the following dependency?
    ```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
      <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
      <version>2.13.3</version>
      <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>
    ```
   Including jackson-databind module from Jackson library in the project allows Java application to easily Serialization and Deserialization between Java objects and JSON data; offers functionality for high-performance, on-demand binding of JSON to POJOs; supports numerous annotations that help in defining exactly how Java objects are written as JSON.

5. What is spring-boot-starter?
   Spring Boot Starters simplify Maven or Gradle project configurations by including a group of related dependencies together. This approach helps developers focus more on their application's business logic rather than on configuration details. Starters are part of the broader Spring Boot philosophy of "convention over configuration," aiming to reduce developer effort and minimize the possibility of errors.
   Each starter is intended for a particular type of development or integration. For example:
        - Web Development: spring-boot-starter-web includes all the dependencies required to create a web application. This includes libraries for Spring MVC, Tomcat as the default embedded container, and commonly used modules like spring-webmvc, spring-web, etc.
        - Data Access: spring-boot-starter-data-jpa bundles the dependencies necessary for using Spring Data JPA to access a database, including libraries like Spring Data JPA itself, Hibernate as the default JPA implementation, and the JDBC API.
        - Testing: spring-boot-starter-test provides dependencies useful for testing Spring Boot applications, such as JUnit, Spring Test, and Mockito.    
    ```xml
    <!--pom.xml-->
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ```     

6. Explain @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST)? could you list CRUD by this style?
    > The @RequestMapping annotation in Spring MVC is used to map web requests to Spring Controller methods. The annotation provides several optional elements to customize the request handling, including value, method, params, headers, and consumes, among others. But with newer versions of Spring, it might prefer more specific annotations which are shortcuts for @RequestMapping, such as @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, and @PatchMapping. These provide better readability and reduce the number of annotation parameters required:
    - `value = "/users"`: This specifies the URL path that the controller method will handle. Here, it handles requests made to the `/users` endpoint.
    - `method = RequestMethod.POST`: This restricts the HTTP method for the request handler to `POST`. Thus, this controller method will only respond to `POST` requests made to `/users`. A `POST` request typically is used to create new resources.
    - Mapping CRUD Operations
      - Create - Use POST to create a new resource.
       ```java
        @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.POST)
        public ResponseEntity<?> createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
            // Logic to create a user
        }
       ```
      - Read - Use GET to read or retrieve resources.
       ```java
        @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.GET)
        public List<User> getAllUsers() {
            // Logic to retrieve all users
        }
        @RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
        public User getUserById(@PathVariable("id") Long id) {
            // Logic to retrieve a user by id
        }
       ```
      - Update - Use PUT or PATCH to update resources.
       ```java
        @RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.PUT)
        public User updateUser(@PathVariable("id") Long id, @RequestBody User updatedUser) {
            // Logic to update a user
        }
        @RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.PATCH)
        public User patchUser(@PathVariable("id") Long id, @RequestBody Map<String, Object> updates) {
            // Logic to apply partial updates to a user
        }
       ```
      - Delete - Use DELETE to remove resources.
       ```java
        @RequestMapping(value = "/users/{id}", method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
        public void deleteUser(@PathVariable("id") Long id) {
            // Logic to delete a user
        }
       ```

7. What is ResponseEntity? Why do we need it?
   `ResponseEntity` is a type in Spring Framework used to represent an entire HTTP response, including status code, headers, and body. It allows more complete control over the response and enables the method to fully configure the HTTP response.
    - Full Control Over the Response: ResponseEntity allows developers to modify the HTTP response status, headers, and body directly from within the method. This is useful when you need to provide additional HTTP headers, change the response status, or return different bodies based on certain conditions.
    - Rich Status Code Management: It provides a fluent API to manipulate the response status. For example, you can return different status codes like 200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found, or any other HTTP status codes depending on the outcome of the request.
    - Generic Type Support: ResponseEntity<T> is a generic type, meaning you can control the type of the body you are returning, providing strong type checking and integration with the rest of your Spring application.

8. What is ResultSet in jdbc? Describe the flow how to get data using JDBC
   A ResultSet is an interface that provides access to the data returned by a database query. ResultSet maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data. The cursor initially is positioned before the first row, and each call to next() moves the cursor to the next row, as long as another row is present. This allows for iterative reading of the data retrieved from a SQL query.
    ```java
   import java.sql.*;

    public class JdbcExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
                Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
                Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(
                "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase", "user", "password");

                Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
                ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM employees");
    
                while (resultSet.next()) {
                    System.out.println(resultSet.getInt("id") + " " + resultSet.getString("name"));
                }
    
                resultSet.close();
                statement.close();
                connection.close();
            } catch (SQLException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
   ```
9. Compare Spring Data JPA vs Hibernate vs JDBC.

    |                         | Spring Data JPA                                                                                                                                          | Hibernate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | JDBC                                                                                                          |

    | Usage                   | JPA is a **standard** of Object Relational Mapping. It is an **interface** that defines a set of annotations for creating the object relational mapping. | Used to map Java classes to database tables and convert Java data types to SQL data types and vice versa. It abstracts much of the database interaction through an API that lets developers manipulate entities rather than dealing with SQL statements. | JDBC is used to execute raw SQL queries and manage database connections.                                      |
    | Control and Flexibility | least control                                                                                                                                            | less control than JDBC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | highest level of control over the database operations                                                         |
    | Portability             | The benefit of using JPA instead of Hibernate is that JPA is a standard and one can switch to any other implementation later.                            | Hibernate is designed to be independent of the underlying database but can sometimes require specific tuning for different database vendors.                                                                                                             | JDBC is database-agnostic. It can work with any database that has a driver that supports JDBC.                |
    | Performance             | Offers similar performance issues and benefits as Hibernate, as it relies on it or another ORM for actual database operations.                           | Generally slower than raw JDBC due to the overhead of mapping and the complexity of the generated SQL                                                                                                                                                    | Typically faster than higher-level abstractions because there is no overhead of additional processing layers. |

10. Learn how to use ObjectMapper by this example.
   https://github.com/TAIsRich/chuwa-eij-tutorial/blob/main/02-java-core/src/main/java/com/chuwa/exercise/oa/api/FoodOutletJackson.java
    ```java
    FoodOutlet foodOutlet = objectMapper.readValue(resBody, FoodOutlet.class);
    String s = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(foodOutlet);
    objectMapper.readTree(); // learn how to use it?
    ```
    - Overview of ObjectMapper Usage
      - Deserialization: Converts JSON string data to Java objects.
      - Serialization: Converts Java objects back to JSON strings.

11. What is the serialization and deserialization?
    - **Serialization**: Serialization is the process of converting an object's state or data structure into a format that can be easily saved to a storage medium (like a file or a database) or transmitted over a network. The format could be binary, XML, JSON, or any other format that a system can handle.
    - **Deserialization**: Deserialization is the opposite process of serialization; it involves converting data from a byte stream into an object or data structure. This is necessary when retrieving data from disk storage or receiving a message from another system over a network.

12. Use stream api to get the average of the array [20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32].
    ```java
        public double getAverage () {
            int[] numbers = {20, 3, 78, 9, 6, 53, 73, 99, 24, 32};
    
            OptionalDouble average = Arrays.stream(numbers).average();
    
            if (average.isPresent()) {
                System.out.println("The average is: " + average.getAsDouble());
                return average.getAsDouble();
            } else {
                throw new IllegalStateException("Could not calculate the average");
            }
        }
    ```
