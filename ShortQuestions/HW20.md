# Some HTML with Javascript


### **Compare  let vs  var with your own code examples.**

To compare `let` and `var` in JavaScript, here are some code examples that highlight their differences:

Example 1: Block Scope

```jsx
if (true) {
    var x = 10;
    let y = 20;
}
console.log(x); // 10
console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined

```

In this example, `var` is function-scoped or globally-scoped, meaning `x` is accessible outside the `if` block. On the other hand, `let` is block-scoped, so `y` is not accessible outside the `if` block.

**Example 2: Hoisting**

```jsx
console.log(a); // undefined
console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization

var a = 5;
let b = 10;

```

Here, `var` is hoisted and initialized with `undefined`, so you can access `a` before its declaration. However, `let` is hoisted but not initialized, leading to a `ReferenceError` when trying to access `b` before its declaration.

**Example 3: Re-declaration**

```jsx
var c = 15;
var c = 20; // No error

let d = 25;
let d = 30; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'd' has already been declared

```

With `var`, you can re-declare the same variable within the same scope without any issues. However, `let` does not allow re-declaration within the same scope, leading to a `SyntaxError`.

**Example 4: Global Object Property**

```jsx
var e = 35;
let f = 40;

console.log(window.e); // 35
console.log(window.f); // undefined

```

When `var` is used to declare a variable in the global scope, it becomes a property of the global `window` object. Conversely, `let` does not create a property on the global object.

These examples illustrate the key differences between `let` and `var` in JavaScript.

### Event Loop, Macrotask, and Microtask Explained with Code Samples

### Event Loop

The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows the execution of multiple pieces of code over time, allowing non-blocking operations like I/O to be handled efficiently. It continuously checks the call stack and the task queue to see if there's any function that needs to be executed.

### Macrotask

Macrotasks are tasks that are added to the task queue and include operations such as `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and I/O operations. Each macrotask is executed one at a time, and the event loop processes the next macrotask only after the current one is completed.

### Microtask

Microtasks are tasks that are executed after the currently executing script and before any macrotasks. They include promises and `MutationObserver`. Microtasks have a higher priority than macrotasks and will be executed immediately after the current script execution, before the event loop continues with the next macrotask.

### Code Samples

```jsx
console.log('Start');

// Macrotask example using setTimeout
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Macrotask 1');
}, 0);

// Microtask example using Promises
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log('Microtask 1');
});

// Additional microtasks
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log('Microtask 2');
});

// Additional macrotask
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Macrotask 2');
}, 0);

console.log('End');

```

### Explanation

1. **Synchronous Code Execution**:
    - `console.log('Start');` is executed first and prints `Start`.
    - `console.log('End');` is executed next and prints `End`.
2. **Microtasks**:
    - The first promise (`Microtask 1`) is resolved and its callback is added to the microtask queue.
    - The second promise (`Microtask 2`) is resolved and its callback is added to the microtask queue.
    - Microtasks are executed immediately after the current script finishes, so `Microtask 1` and `Microtask 2` are printed next.
3. **Macrotasks**:
    - The first `setTimeout` callback (`Macrotask 1`) is added to the macrotask queue.
    - The second `setTimeout` callback (`Macrotask 2`) is added to the macrotask queue.
    - After all microtasks are executed, the event loop processes the macrotasks in the queue, so `Macrotask 1` and `Macrotask 2` are printed last.

**Output**:

```
Start
End
Microtask 1
Microtask 2
Macrotask 1
Macrotask 2

```

This demonstrates how the event loop handles the execution of synchronous code, microtasks, and macrotasks in a prioritized manner.
