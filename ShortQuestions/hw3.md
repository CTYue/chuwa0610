2. What is the checked exception and unchecked exception in Java, could you give one example?
- checked exception: compile exception
  - IOException, SQLException
- unchecked exception: runtime exception
  - IndexOutOfBoundsException, ArithmeticException
3. Can there be multiple finally blocks?  
    No     


4. When both catch and finally return values, what will be the final result?
    value in finally.


5. What is Runtime/unchecked exception? what is Compile/Checked Exception?
    - runtime exception/unchecked exception
      - extends Exception
    - compile/checked exception
      - extends RuntimeException
6. What is the difference between throw and throws?
   - both related to exception
   - throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception in try catch block
     ```
     try {
            
            throw new ArithmeticException("This is an example of throwing an exception");
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
     ```

   - throws keyword is used in method declarations to specify that the method may throw one or more exceptions.
     - ```returnType methodName(parameterList) throws exception1, exception2, ...;```
7. Run the below three pieces codes, Noticed the printed exceptions. why do we put the Null/Runtime
   exception before Exception ?
    catch scope should be from small to large.
    Exception has the biggest scope.


7. What is optional? why do you use it? write an optional example.
-  type-level solution for representing optional values instead of null references.
- handle scenarios where a value may be absent
```
@Test
public void TEST() {
    String name = "baeldung";
    Optional<String> opt = Optional.of(name);
    assertTrue(opt.isPresent());
}
```
8.  Why finally always be executed ?
- clean up purpose
  - close FileReader

9.  Practice collection problems here:    
    - [folder](../Coding/collection)
    

10. What are the types of design patterns in Java ?   
    - Creational Patterns
      - Singleton Pattern, Factory Method Pattern, Abstract Factory Pattern
    - Structural Patterns
      - Adapter Pattern, Decorator Pattern, Facade Pattern
    - Behavior Patterns
      - Observer Pattern, Strategy Pattern, Iterator Pattern
    
11. What are the SOLID Principles ?
    - Single Responsibility Principle
      - each class has only one responsibility
    - Open/Close Principle
      - open to extension, close to modification
    - Liskov Substitution Principle
      - superclass should be replaceable by its subclasses without affecting the correctness
    - Interface Segregation Principle
      - clients should not depend on interface they don't use, better to have small, more specific interfaces
    - Dependency Inversion Principle
      - high-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules classes, Both should depend on abstractions.
    

12. How can you achieve thread-safe singleton patterns in Java ?
    ```
    // static volatible variable
    // make constructor private
    // static synchornize getInstance method
    public class Singeleton {
        private static Singeleton instance = new Singeleton();
        private Singeleton(){}
        public static Singeleton getInstance() {
            return instance;
        }
    }
    ```
13. What do you understand by the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) ?
    open to extension, close to modification.
    Using interface and abstract classes to define contracts that can be implemented or extended by difference classes without changing existing code.


14. Liskovâ€™s substitution principle states that if class B is a subtype of class A, then object of type A may be
            substituted with any object of type B. What does this actually mean? (from OA ) choose your answer.

    select 3

    ~~1.It means that if the object of type A can do something, the object of type B could also be able tp
        perform the same thing~~   
    ~~2. It means that all the objects of type A could execute all the methods present in its subtype B~~     
    3 It means if a method is present in class A, it should also be present in class B so that the object of
                type B could substitute object of type A.   
    ~~4. It means that for the class B to inherit class A, objects of type B and objects of type A must be same.~~
