2.  Compare Spring and Springboot? What are the benfits of Srpingboot?
### Spring
- **Framework:** A comprehensive framework for enterprise-level Java applications.
- **Configuration:** Requires significant configuration (XML or Java-based).
- **Setup:** Complex setup for new projects.
- **Dependency Management:** Manual handling of dependencies.

### Spring Boot
- **Framework:** A framework that simplifies the development of Spring applications.
- **Configuration:** Minimizes configuration with auto-configuration.
- **Setup:** Easy setup with a built-in server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.).
- **Dependency Management:** Simplified with Spring Boot starters.

## Benefits of Spring Boot
- **Auto-configuration:** Automatically configures Spring applications based on the dependencies.
- **Embedded Server:** Comes with an embedded server, making it easy to run applications.
- **Starter Dependencies:** Simplifies dependency management with starter POMs.
- **Production-ready:** Provides features like metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.

3.  What is IOC and What is DI?
## Inversion of Control (IoC)
- **Definition:** A design principle where the control of object creation and management is transferred from the program to a container or framework.
- **Purpose:** To decouple the application components and improve modularity.

## Dependency Injection (DI)
- **Definition:** A technique to implement IoC where the framework injects dependencies into objects.
- **Types:**
  - Constructor Injection
  - Setter Injection
  - Field Injection

4.  What is  @CompnonentScan ?
@ComponentScan is an annotation in Spring Framework that is used to specify the base packages to scan for Spring components. It helps Spring to automatically detect and register beans in the application context.

5.  What is  @SpringbootApplication ?
@SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation in Spring Boot that combines three annotations: @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan, and @Configuration. It is used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application and to enable auto-configuration, component scanning, and configuration.

6.  How many ways to define a bean? Provide code examples.
``` java
Component:
@Component
public class MyBean {
    // Bean implementation
}

Bean:
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    
    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}

XML:
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">
    
    <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean"/>
</beans>

Define a bean using Java-based configuration without annotations:
public class AppConfig {
    
    public MyBean myBean() {
        return new MyBean();
    }
}

AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
MyBean myBean = context.getBean(MyBean.class);

```
7.  What is default bean name for  @Component  and  @Bean ? Also compare  @Component  and  @Bean
@Component: The default bean name is the class name with the first letter decapitalized. For example, if the class name is MyService, the default bean name is myService.
Used to indicate that a class is a Spring-managed component.
Applied directly to the class.
Suitable for automatic component scanning and registration.

@Bean: The default bean name is the name of the method annotated with @Bean. For example, if the method name is myBean, the default bean name is myBean.
Used to explicitly declare a single bean and is typically used within a @Configuration class.
Applied to a method that returns an object, which is then registered as a bean.
Suitable for more complex bean definitions, especially when you need to control the instantiation logic.

8.  Compare  @component  and  @service , @repository ,  @controller ?
@Component:
Generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
Used for classes that do not fall under the categories of service, repository, or controller.

@Service:
Specialized @Component indicating that the class holds business logic.
Used for service layer classes.

@Repository:
Specialized @Component indicating that the class interacts with the database.
Provides additional features for exception translation in the persistence layer.

@Controller:
Specialized @Component indicating that the class handles HTTP requests.
Used in web applications to define controllers.

9.  Explain  @Autowired ,  @Qualifier  ,  @Resource  and  @Primary ?
@Autowired:
Automatically injects the required dependencies by type.

@Qualifier:
Used alongside @Autowired to resolve the conflict when there are multiple beans of the same type.

@Resource:
JSR-250 annotation that injects dependencies by name first, then by type.

@Primary:
Indicates that a bean should be given preference when multiple candidates are available.

10.  How many annotaitons we can use to inject a bean?
@Autowired
@Qualifier
@Resource
@Inject (JSR-330)

11.  Explain and compare differnet types of denpendency injection, their pros and cons, and use cases.

Constructor Injection:
Dependencies are provided through the constructor.
Pros: Immutable dependencies, easier testing.
Cons: Verbose with many dependencies.
Use Case: When dependencies are required and should not change.

Setter Injection:
Dependencies are provided through setter methods.
Pros: Optional dependencies, easy to change dependencies.
Cons: Mutable dependencies.
Use Case: When dependencies are optional or changeable.

Field Injection:
Dependencies are injected directly into the fields.
Pros: Less boilerplate code.
Cons: Difficult to test, less control over injection.
Use Case: When quick and straightforward injection is needed.

12.  If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how Spring IOC picks one bean to inject if no primay.
Setting a Primary Bean:
@Primary

Handling Multiple Beans Without @Primary:
@Autowired
@Qualifier("specificBean")
private MyService myService;

13.  Compare BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring framework?

BeanFactory:
Basic container providing basic dependency injection.
Lazy initialization of beans.
No built-in support for AOP, internationalization, or event propagation.

ApplicationContext:
Advanced container built on top of BeanFactory.
Eager initialization of singleton beans by default.
Supports AOP, internationalization, event propagation, and more.

14.  Explain bean scope in Spring IOC?  List bean scopes with explainations and code examples if possible.
```java
Singleton:
@Scope("singleton")
@Component
public class MySingletonBean {
}

Prototype:
@Scope("prototype")
@Component
public class MyPrototypeBean {
}

Request:
@Scope("request")

Session:
@Scope("session")

Global Session:
@Scope("globalSession")

Applicaion:
@Scope("application")

```
15.  Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? 
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">
    
    <bean id="dependencyBean" class="com.example.DependencyBean"/>
    
    <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
        <constructor-arg ref="dependencyBean"/>
        <property name="property" value="value"/>
    </bean>
</beans>

16.  Do Q15 without xml, use Springboot IOC annotations instead.
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    
    @Bean
    public DependencyBean dependencyBean() {
        return new DependencyBean();
    }
    
    @Bean
    public MyBean myBean(DependencyBean dependencyBean) {
        MyBean myBean = new MyBean(dependencyBean);
        myBean.setProperty("value");
        return myBean;
    }
}
```
