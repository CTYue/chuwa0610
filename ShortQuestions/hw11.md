## 1.  List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md (your own cheatsheet).

## 2.  Compare Spring and Springboot? What are the benfits of Srpingboot?
* Spring is a popular lightweight Java framework for building web applications.
* Spring Boot framework was developed to avoid the time-consuming routine of Spring.

## 3.  What is IOC and What is DI?
* IOC (Inversion of Control): IOC is a programming principle that is used to invert the flow of control in an application. Instead of the application being responsible for controlling the flow of execution, IOC allows the framework or container to take control.
* DI (Dependency Injection): DI, on the other hand, is a design pattern that is used to manage the dependencies between different components in an application. In DI, the dependencies are "injected" into a component by a container or framework, rather than the component itself creating or managing its own dependencies.

## 4.  What is  @CompnonentScan ?
* With Spring, we use the @ComponentScan annotation along with the @Configuration annotation to specify the packages that we want to be scanned. @ComponentScan without arguments tells Spring to scan the current package and all of its sub-packages.

## 5.  What is  @SpringbootApplication ?
* A single @SpringBootApplication annotation can be used to enable those three features, that is:
* @EnableAutoConfiguration: enable Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration mechanism
* @ComponentScan: enable @Component scan on the package where the application is located (see the best practices)
* @Configuration: allow to register extra beans in the context or import additional configuration classes

## 6.  How many ways to define a bean? Provide code examples.
* 1) xml
``` java
<bean id="AnyUniqueId" class="YourClassName">
</bean>
```

* 2) @Component
``` java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
 
@Component("collegeBean")
public class College {
    public void test()
    {
        System.out.println("Test College Method");
    }
}
```

* 3) @Bean

``` java
@Bean
public College collegeBean(){
    return new College();
}
```

## 7.  What is default bean name for  @Component  and  @Bean ? Also compare  @Component  and  @Bean .
* class name and converts the first letter to lowercase.
* @Component is used for automatic scanning and registering of beans, @Bean is used for explicit manual registration of beans.

## 8.  Compare  @component  and  @service , @repository ,  @controller ?
* @Component: @Component is a class-level annotation. It is used to denote a class as a Component.
* @Service: In an application, the business logic resides within the service layer so we use the @Service Annotation to indicate that a class belongs to that layer. It is a specialization of @Component Annotation. One most important thing about the @Service Annotation is it can be applied only to classes. It is used to mark the class as a service provider.
* @Repository: @Repository Annotation is also a specialization of @Component annotation which is used to indicate that the class provides the mechanism for storage, retrieval, update, delete and search operation on objects. 
* @Controller: Spring @Controller annotation is also a specialization of @Component annotation. The @Controller annotation indicates that a particular class serves the role of a controller.

## 9.  Explain  @Autowired ,  @Qualifier  ,  @Resource  and  @Primary ?
* @Autowired: Allows Spring to automatically inject dependencies into the class, eliminating the need for manual configuration.
* @Qualifier: indicate which bean we want to use
* @Primary: The bean associated with the @Primary annotation will be used unless otherwise indicated.
* @Resource: inject by name.
* If you intend to express annotation-driven injection by name, do not primarily use @Autowired - even if is technically capable of referring to a bean name through @Qualifier values. Instead, prefer the JSR-250 @Resource annotation which is semantically defined to identify a specific target component by its unique name, with the declared type being irrelevant for the matching process.

## 10.  How many annotaitons we can use to inject a bean?
* @Autowired, @Resource and @Inject

## 11.  Explain and compare differnet types of denpendency injection, their pros and cons, and use cases.
Setter: Dependencies are injected using setter methods, Partial dependency injection is supported, More readable, Less secure than constructor inject, because while using setter injection, you can override certain dependency by sub-classes overridden setter methods. If two objects dependent each other, the circular dependency has no effect as objects use setter methods of other.
Constructor: Dependencies are injected using constructor arguments. Partial dependency injection is not supported, Default constructor is not mandatory. Less Readable when there is more number of properties in class. More secure than setter inject as dependency cannot be overridden, sub-classes still has to invoke super class constructors. If two objects dependent each other, the circular dependency has an effect and exception will be thrown from spring. One object has to wait for other object creation; both the objects wait for other creation results in ObjectCurrentlyInCreationException.

## 12.  If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how Spring IOC picks one bean to inject if no primay.
* @Primary
* @Autowired: Try to find by name, if not found, find by type
* @Qualifier: find by bean's name

## 13.  Compare BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring framework?
* BeanFactory loads beans on-demand, while ApplicationContext loads all beans at startup. 

## 14.  Explain bean scope in Spring IOC?  List bean scopes with explainations and code examples if possible.
### Singleton
* A single instance of the bean is created and shared across the entire Spring IoC container. This is the default scope if no other scope is specified.
``` java
@Component
@Scope("singleton")
public class MySingletonBean {
}
```

### Prototype Scope
* A new instance of the bean is created every time it is requested from the Spring container.
``` java
@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class MyPrototypeBean {
    // Bean logic here
}
```

### Request Scope
* A single instance of the bean is created and available for the lifecycle of a single HTTP request. This scope is valid only in a web-aware Spring application context.
``` java
@Component
@Scope("request")
public class MyRequestBean {
    // Bean logic here
}
```

### Session Scope
* A single instance of the bean is created and available for the lifecycle of an HTTP session. This scope is also valid only in a web-aware Spring application context.
``` java
@Component
@Scope("session")
public class MySessionBean {
    // Bean logic here
}
```

### Global Session Scope
* Similar to the session scope but used for portlet-based web applications. It creates a single instance of the bean for the lifecycle of a global HTTP session.
``` java
@Component
@Scope("globalSession")
public class MyGlobalSessionBean {
    // Bean logic here
}
```

### Application Scope
* A single instance of the bean is created and available for the lifecycle of a single HTTP request. This scope is valid only in a web-aware Spring application context.
``` java
@Component
@Scope("application")
public class MyApplicationBean {
    // Bean logic here
}
```

## 15.  Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? 
``` java
<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
    <property name="name" value="John Doe"/>
    <property name="age" value="30"/>
</bean>
```

## 16.  Do Q15 without xml, use Springboot IOC annotations instead.
``` java
@Component
public class MyBean {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public MyBean(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // getters and setters
}
```
