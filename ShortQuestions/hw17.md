## 2. Document the microservice architeture and components/tools/dependencies.
- Spring Cloud:
Spring Cloud is an umbrella project that provides a set of tools to quickly build common patterns in distributed systems. It builds on top of Spring Boot, making it easy to set up and run. Spring Cloud simplifies the development of distributed systems by offering solutions for configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing, and more.

- Zuul API Gateway
Zuul is an edge service that provides dynamic routing, monitoring, resiliency, security, and more. It acts as an API Gateway in a microservice architecture, handling all the requests and routing them to the appropriate backend services. Zuul helps manage communication between clients and services, providing features like load balancing, authentication, and authorization.

- Eureka
Eureka is a service registry provided by Netflix, and it is part of the Spring Cloud Netflix stack. It allows microservices to register themselves at runtime as they come up and go down, making it easier for other services to discover them. Eureka helps manage service discovery in a dynamic environment where services can scale up and down.

- Ribbon Load Balancer
Ribbon is a client-side load balancer that provides software load balancing algorithms and strategies. It is used in conjunction with Eureka to provide intelligent routing and load balancing for HTTP and TCP clients. Ribbon distributes the load across available service instances, ensuring high availability and reliability.

- Hystrix Circuit Breaker
Hystrix is a library from Netflix that implements the circuit breaker pattern, which helps prevent cascading failures in a distributed system. It provides latency and fault tolerance, ensuring that failures in one part of the system do not propagate to other parts. Hystrix wraps calls to external services and monitors their status, opening the circuit if the failure threshold is reached to stop further calls until the service recovers.

- Config Server
Spring Cloud Config Server provides server-side and client-side support for externalized configuration in a distributed system. It allows applications to manage their configuration properties using a central repository, such as Git, which makes it easy to update configurations across multiple instances and environments without redeploying the applications.

- Kafka
Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform used to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It is designed to handle high-throughput, fault-tolerant messaging. Kafka is often used in microservice architectures for event-driven communication between services, enabling asynchronous processing and decoupling service dependencies.

- Docker
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside lightweight containers. Containers provide a consistent runtime environment, making it easier to manage dependencies and configurations. In a microservice architecture, Docker enables the packaging of services with their dependencies, ensuring that they run reliably in different environments. Docker simplifies the deployment, scaling, and management of microservices.

## 3. What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?
Resilience patterns are architectural design patterns that help systems handle and recover from failures gracefully. These patterns are crucial in distributed systems and microservices architectures, where components interact over unreliable networks and depend on external services that might fail. Implementing resilience patterns ensures that a system remains responsive, reliable, and robust even in the face of partial failures.  
Common Resilience Patterns:
1. Circuit Breaker
2. Retry Pattern
3. Fallback Pattern
4. Bulkhead Pattern
5. Timeout Pattern
6. Rate Limiting
7. Fail-Fast
8. Graceful Degradation  
The Circuit Breaker pattern is used to prevent cascading failures and enable systems to quickly recover from faults. It monitors the interactions between services and stops calls to a service if it detects a failure threshold has been reached. This helps avoid overloading the failing service and allows it time to recover.

## 4. Read this article,then list the important questions, then write your answers
- What are the benefits and drawbacks of Microservices?  
Benefits: easy to test and maintain. Stable and independent. One failed microservice would not affect the entire program.  
Drawbacks: security, complex development. Pre-planning is required.

## 5. how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.
1. Set up Eureka Server:  
Create and configure a Spring Boot project with `@EnableEurekaServer`, then run the Eureka server.
2. Set up Microservices/Eureka Clients with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer:  
Create and configure Spring Boot microservices with `@EnableEurekaClient`, `RestTemplate`, `WebClient`, and `@LoadBalanced`. Run the microservices.
3. Set up Nginx:  
Install and configure Nginx to load balance requests to the microservice instances.
4. Integrate Eureka with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer:  
Verify Spring Cloud LoadBalancer is discovering services via Eureka.

## 6. How to do service discovery?
1. Set up Eureka Server: Create and configure a Spring Boot project with `@EnableEurekaServer`, then run the Eureka server.
2. Set Up Eureka Clients (Microservices): Use Spring Initializr to create separate Spring Boot projects for each microservice. Include dependencies for Eureka Client and Spring Boot.
3. Run and Verify: Start Eureka Server and microservices. Visit `http://localhost:8761` to see all the registered services.
