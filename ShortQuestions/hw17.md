   10. **Containerization and Orchestration**:
       - **Role**: Simplifies deployment, scaling, and management of microservices.
       - **Example**: Docker, Kubernetes.

3. What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?

   Resilienc patterns help systems recover gracefully from failures and maintain functionality even when some components fail.

   #### Key Resilience Patterns:

   1. **Retry**:
      - **Description**: Automatically retries a failed operation after a certain interval.
      - **Use Case**: Temporary network issues or transient errors.
   2. **Circuit Breaker**:
      - **Description**: Prevents repetitive failures by temporarily blocking requests to a failing service.
      - **Use Case**: When a service is down or unresponsive.
   3. **Fallback**:
      - **Description**: Provides an alternative response or action when the primary request fails.
      - **Use Case**: Ensuring graceful degradation of functionality.
   4. **Bulkhead**:
      - **Description**: Isolates different parts of the system to prevent a failure in one component from affecting others.
      - **Use Case**: Limiting the impact of failures and resource contention.
   5. **Timeout**:
      - **Description**: Sets a maximum time to wait for a response from a service before considering it failed.
      - **Use Case**: Avoiding long waits for unresponsive services.
   6. **Rate Limiting**:
      - **Description**: Controls the rate at which requests are sent to a service to prevent overload.
      - **Use Case**: Managing load and protecting services from being overwhelmed.
   7. **Cache**:
      - **Description**: Stores frequently accessed data temporarily to reduce the load on services.
      - **Use Case**: Improving performance and reducing latency.

   #### How Circuit Breaker Works:

   1. **Closed State**:
      - In this state, the circuit breaker allows requests to pass through to the service. If the requests succeed, the circuit breaker remains in the closed state.
   2. **Open State**:
      - When a specified number of consecutive failures occur, the circuit breaker trips and moves to the open state. In this state, it blocks all requests to the service and typically returns an error or fallback response.
   3. **Half-Open State**:
      - After a certain period, the circuit breaker allows a limited number of test requests to pass through. If these requests succeed, the circuit breaker resets to the closed state. If they fail, it returns to the open state.

5. How to load balance in Microservices?

   #### Key Methods of Load Balancing in Microservices

   1. **Client-Side Load Balancing**:
      - In client-side load balancing, the client maintains a list of available service instances and decides which instance to send requests to. This approach is often used in conjunction with service discovery mechanisms.
      - **Example Tools**: Ribbon (now deprecated, used in older Spring Cloud versions), Spring Cloud LoadBalancer.
   2. **Server-Side Load Balancing**:
      - Server-side load balancing involves a central load balancer that receives incoming requests and distributes them across multiple service instances.
      - **Example Tools**: HAProxy, NGINX, F5, AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB).
   3. **Service Mesh**:
      - A service mesh is an infrastructure layer for managing service-to-service communication. It abstracts the logic for load balancing, traffic management, and security away from individual services into a dedicated infrastructure layer.
      - **Example Tools**: Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect.

   #### Load Balancing Strategies

   1. **Round Robin**:
      - Distributes requests sequentially to each available server in order.
      - **Use Case**: Simple and effective for evenly distributed workloads.
   2. **Random**:
      - Distributes requests randomly among available servers.
      - **Use Case**: Suitable for unpredictable traffic patterns.
   3. **Least Connections**:
      - Directs requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
      - **Use Case**: Effective for uneven workloads, ensuring the least busy server gets the new request.
   4. **Weighted Round Robin**:
      - Assigns a weight to each server based on its capacity and distributes requests accordingly.
      - **Use Case**: Useful when servers have different capacities or performance capabilities.
   5. **IP Hash**:
      - Distributes requests based on the hash of the client’s IP address, ensuring the same client is consistently routed to the same server.
      - **Use Case**: Useful for session persistence and stateful applications.

6. How to do service discovery?

   #### Types of Service Discovery

   1. **Client-Side Discovery**:
      - In client-side discovery, the client is responsible for determining the network locations of available service instances. The client queries a service registry to get the instances and then uses a load-balancing algorithm to select one of the instances.
   2. **Server-Side Discovery**:
      - In server-side discovery, the client sends a request to a load balancer, which then queries the service registry to determine the available instances and forwards the client’s request to an appropriate instance.

   #### Service Discovery Mechanisms

   1. **Service Registry**:
      - A service registry is a database of available service instances, which are dynamically updated as services register and deregister themselves.
      - **Examples**: Eureka, Consul, Zookeeper.
   2. **DNS-Based Discovery**:
      - Uses DNS to discover services, where service instances are registered with DNS servers and clients use standard DNS queries to discover service instances.
