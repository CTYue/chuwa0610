2.  Document the microservice architeture and components/tools/dependencies
Microservice Architecture Overview:
A microservice architecture decomposes a large application into a collection of small, independent services. Each service focuses on a specific business capability and has its own codebase, deployment process, and lifecycle. This approach offers several advantages, including:
Scalability: Individual services can be scaled independently based on their specific needs.
Increased Agility: Independent development and deployment cycles enable faster development and updates.
Improved Fault Tolerance: Failure in one service is less likely to impact the entire system.
Flexibility: Different programming languages and technologies can be used for different services.
Components:
Microservices: These are the core building blocks of the architecture, each implementing a specific business function.
API Gateway: A single entry point for all API requests to the application, handling routing and security.
Service Discovery: A mechanism for microservices to discover the location of other services they need to interact with.
Containerization: Microservices are typically packaged as containers (e.g., Docker containers) for ease of deployment and management.
Orchestration: A tool like Kubernetes can be used to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized microservices.
Data Storage: Microservices can utilize various data storage solutions based on their needs, such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, or key-value stores.
Tools and Dependencies:
Container Platform: Docker (containerization) and Kubernetes (orchestration) are popular choices.
Service Discovery: Options include Consul, Eureka, or Zookeeper.
API Gateway: Tools like Kong, Apigee, or AWS API Gateway can be used.
Configuration Management: Tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet can be used to manage configurations across microservices.
Monitoring and Logging: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) can be used for monitoring and logging purposes.

3.  What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?
Resilience Patterns:
Focus: These patterns focus on building fault tolerance and preventing cascading failures within a system.
Examples: Some common resilience patterns include:
Retry: Automatically retry failed operations after a certain delay, especially for transient errors.
Circuit Breaker: Automatically stop sending requests to a failing service for a period to prevent overloading it further, then retry after some time.
Bulkhead: Isolate failures within a specific bounded area (like a service or group of services) to prevent them from propagating throughout the entire system.
Timeout: Set a maximum time limit for an operation to complete, and fail gracefully if it exceeds the limit.
Fallback: Implement a fallback strategy to provide a degraded functionality in case of failures.
Circuit Breaker Pattern:
Concept: The circuit breaker acts as a switch that controls the flow of traffic to a potentially unreliable service. It monitors the health of a service and takes specific actions based on its state:
Closed: This is the initial state where the circuit breaker allows requests to pass through to the service.
Open: If the service experiences a high number of failures within a defined threshold, the circuit breaker trips and enters an open state. In this state, subsequent requests are no longer forwarded to the service, but are instead handled by a fallback mechanism (if defined). This prevents further overload on the failing service.
Half-Open: After a certain timeout period in the open state, the circuit breaker transitions to a half-open state. It allows a single request to pass through to the service. If the request succeeds, the circuit breaker resets to the closed state. However, if the request fails again, the circuit breaker flips back to the open state with a potentially increased timeout value.

Benefits of Circuit Breaker:
Prevents Cascading Failures: By isolating failing services, circuit breaker prevents failures from cascading to other healthy services and impacting the entire system.
Protects Downstream Services: It prevents healthy services from being overloaded with requests directed to a failing service.
Enables Self-Healing: The open/half-open state allows the failing service time to recover, and the system can automatically attempt to reconnect when it's healthy again.

Explain CDC.
As the name implies, CDC (Consumer-Driven Contract) basically ensures service communication compatibility by establishing an agreement between consumers and service providers regarding the format of the data exchanged between them. An agreement like this is called a contract. Basically, it is a pattern used to develop Microservices so that they can be efficiently used by external systems.

Write main components of Microservices.
Some of the main components of microservices include: 
Containers, Clustering, and Orchestration 
IaC [Infrastructure as Code Conception] 
Cloud Infrastructure 
API Gateway 
Enterprise Service Bus 
Service Delivery 

What are the benefits and drawbacks of Microservices?

Explain spring cloud and spring boot.
Spring Cloud: In Microservices, the Spring cloud is a system that integrates with external systems. This is a short-lived framework designed to build applications quickly. It contributes significantly to microservice architecture due to its association with finite amounts of data processing. Some of the features of spring cloud are shown below:
Spring Boot: Spring Boot is an open-sourced, Java-based framework that provides its developers with a platform on which they can create stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications. In addition to reducing development time and increasing productivity, it is easily understood. 

What is the role of actuator in spring boot?
A spring boot actuator is a project that provides restful web services to access the current state of an application that is running in production. In addition, you can monitor and manage application usage in a production environment without having to code or configure any of the applications

Explain how independent microservices communicate with each other.
Communication between microservices can take place through: 
HTTP/REST with JSON or binary protocol for request-response 
Websockets for streaming.  
A broker or server program that uses advanced routing algorithms.  
RabbitMQ, Nats, Kafka, etc., can be used as message brokers; each is built to handle a particular message semantic. You can also use Backend as a Service like Space Cloud to automate your entire backend. 

5.  how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.
Round Robin: This is the simplest strategy where requests are distributed sequentially to available microservice instances. It's easy to implement but may not be ideal for scenarios with uneven workloads across instances.
Least Connections: This approach directs traffic to the instance with the fewest active connections, aiming for a balanced distribution. It works well for dynamic workloads, but might not be suitable if connection setup times are significant.
IP Hash: This strategy routes requests to a specific instance based on the client's IP address. This ensures users consistently connect to the same instance for a session, potentially beneficial for stateful microservices. However, it can lead to uneven distribution if the client IP address distribution is skewed.
Weighted Round Robin: This approach assigns weights to each microservice instance based on factors like processing power or capacity. Requests are then distributed proportionally to the weights, allowing you to prioritize instances with higher capacity.
Priority-Based: Here, you can define priorities for different microservices based on their criticality. Traffic is routed to high-priority services first, ensuring their responsiveness even under high load. This requires careful consideration of service dependencies and criticality.

6.  How to do service discovery?
Service discovery is a crucial aspect of microservice architectures. It allows microservices to dynamically locate each other at runtime, enabling communication and collaboration.
Benefits of Service Discovery:
Dynamic Service Location: Microservices can find each other regardless of their physical location or changes in deployment.
Simplified Development: Developers don't need to hardcode service addresses, making code more maintainable and flexible.
Improved Scalability: Adding or removing microservice instances becomes easier as the registry reflects the current deployment state.
Resilience: If a service becomes unavailable, the discovery mechanism can direct traffic to healthy instances.
How Service Discovery Works:
Registration: Microservices register themselves with a service discovery registry, providing their network address and health information.
Discovery: When a microservice needs to interact with another, it queries the registry using the service name or ID.
Resolution: The registry returns the location information (address) of the target service.
Communication: The microservice uses the retrieved address to communicate with the target service.
