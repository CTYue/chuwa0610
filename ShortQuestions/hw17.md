## 3.What is Resilience Patterns and Circuit Breaker

- What are Resilience patterns?
  - Resilience patterns are design strategies used in software architecture to ensure that applications remain functional and responsive under various failure conditions. These patterns help to handle faults gracefully, maintain availability, and recover quickly from errors.
- What is a circuit breaker?
  - A circuit breaker is a resilience pattern that prevents a system from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that's likely to fail. It monitors the success and failure of operations and, upon detecting a certain threshold of failures, opens the circuit to stop further attempts, allowing the system to recover or fallback to a different strategy.

## Article Review

- Read the article: [Microservices Interview Questions](https://www.interviewbit.com/microservices-interview-questions/#main-features-of-microservices)
- List the important questions from the article.
- Write answers to those questions.

1. **Explain CDC**

As the name implies, CDC (Consumer-Driven Contract) basically ensures service communication compatibility by establishing an agreement between consumers and service providers regarding the format of the data exchanged between them. An agreement like this is called a contract. Basically, it is a pattern used to develop Microservices so that they can be efficiently used by external systems.

2. **What issues are generally solved by spring clouds?**

The following problems can be solved with Spring Cloud:

- **Complicated issues caused by distributed systems**: This includes network issues, latency problems, bandwidth problems, and security issues.

- **Redundancy issues**: Distributed systems can often have redundancy issues.
- **Load balancing issues**: Optimize the distribution of workloads among multiple computing resources, including computer clusters, central processing units, and network links.
- **Reduces performance issues**: Reduces performance issues caused by various operational overheads.

- Cloud Infrastructure
- API Gateway
- Enterprise Service Bus
- Service Delivery

4. **What are the benefits and drawbacks of Microservices?**

**Benefits:**

- Self-contained, and independent deployment module.
- Independently managed services.
- In order to improve performance, the demand service can be deployed on multiple servers.
- It is easier to test and has fewer dependencies.
- A greater degree of scalability and agility.
- Simplicity in debugging & maintenance.
- Better communication between developers and business users.
- Development teams of a smaller size.

**Drawbacks:**

- Due to the complexity of the architecture, testing and monitoring are more difficult.
- Lacks the proper corporate culture for it to work.
- Pre-planning is essential.
- Complex development.
- Requires a cultural shift.
- Expensive compared to monoliths.
- Security implications.
- Maintaining the network is more difficult.

5. Explain the working of Microservice Architecture

Microservice architectures consist of the following components:

- **Clients**: Different users send requests from various devices.
- **Identity Provider**: Validate a user's or client's identity and issue security tokens.
- **API Gateway**: Handles the requests from clients.
- **Static Content**: Contains all of the system's content.
- **Management**: Services are balanced on nodes and failures are identified.
- **Service Discovery**: A guide to discovering the routes of communication between microservices.
- **Content Delivery Network**: Includes a distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers.
- **Remote Service**: Provides remote access to data or information that resides on networked computers and devices.

### Workflow:

1. **Client Interaction**:
   - Clients send requests to the system from various devices.
   
2. **Identity Validation**:
   - The Identity Provider validates the client's identity and issues security tokens.

3. **API Gateway**:
   - The API Gateway receives and handles the client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices.
   
4. **Static Content Delivery**:
   - Static content is served to the client as needed.

5. **Microservices Handling**:
   - The requests are processed by various microservices, which may interact with each other and with remote services as needed.
   
6. **Service Management**:
   - Management services ensure that services are balanced on nodes and handle failures as they occur.
   
7. **Service Discovery**:
   - Service Discovery helps in identifying the routes for communication between different microservices.
   
8. **Content Delivery Network**:
   - The CDN helps in distributing the content efficiently across multiple proxy servers and data centers.
   
9. **Remote Service Access**:
   - Remote Services provide access to data or information that is stored on other networked computers and devices.

6. Explain Spring Cloud and Spring Boot

**Spring Cloud**: In Microservices, the Spring cloud is a system that integrates with external systems. This is a short-lived framework designed to build applications quickly. It contributes significantly to microservice architecture due to its association with finite amounts of data processing. Some of the features of spring cloud are shown below:

![Spring Cloud Features](https://interviewbit.com/)

- **Distributed Configuration**: Manage configurations across distributed systems.
- **Distributed Messaging**: Enable communication between distributed systems.
- **Service to Service Calls**: Facilitate interactions between services.
- **Circuit Breakers**: Handle fault tolerance in distributed systems.
- **Global Locks**: Manage locks across distributed systems.
- **Service Registration**: Register services for discovery.
- **Service Discovery**: Discover services dynamically.
- **Load Balancing**: Balance loads across services.
- **Cluster State**: Manage the state of the cluster.
- **Routing**: Route requests to appropriate services.

**Spring Boot**: Spring Boot is an open-sourced, Java-based framework that provides its developers with a platform on which they can create stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications. In addition to reducing development time and increasing productivity, it is easily understood.



## Load Balancing in Microservices

- Read the articles:
  - [Load Balancer System Design](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/load-balancer-system-design-interview-question/)
  - [Load Balancing Interview Questions](https://www.fullstack.cafe/blog/load-balancing-interview-questions)
- Write a long summary on how to do load balancing in microservices.

### Why Use a Load Balancer?

- **Distributes Traffic**: Spreads incoming requests across multiple servers.
- **Improves Performance**: Enhances response times and overall system efficiency.
- **Increases Availability**: Ensures high availability and reliability of applications.

### When to Use?

- **High Traffic Websites**: To manage heavy loads.
- **Redundancy Needs**: For failover and disaster recovery.
- **Scalability**: To handle varying traffic volumes.

### Pros of Using Load Balancer

- **Optimized Resource Utilization**: Maximizes server usage.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Minimizes downtime and service interruptions.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale up/down based on demand.

### If Not Used

- **Single Point of Failure**: Increases risk of downtime.
- **Inefficient Resource Use**: Servers may be under or over-utilized.
- **Poor Performance**: Slower response times during high traffic.


## 6. How to do service discovery?
### Methods

1. **Client-Side Discovery**:
   - Clients query a service registry to discover service instances and then load balance requests across available instances.
   - **Tools**: Eureka, Consul

2. **Server-Side Discovery**:
   - A load balancer queries the service registry and routes client requests to available service instances.
   - **Tools**: NGINX, HAProxy

3. **DNS-Based Discovery**:
   - Uses DNS to map service names to their respective IP addresses.
   - **Tools**: AWS Route 53, Consul

### Pros

- **Automated Updates**: Services are registered and deregistered dynamically.
- **Load Balancing**: Efficient distribution of requests.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Provides redundancy and failover capabilities.

### If Not Used

- **Manual Updates**: Increased complexity in maintaining service locations.
- **Single Point of Failure**: Higher risk of downtime and unavailability.
- **Scalability Issues**: Difficulty in handling dynamic scaling of services.
