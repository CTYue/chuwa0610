## 8.  How do you understand PR is based on Branch?

## 9.  What is maven role ? what it be used to do ?

## 10.  What is the lifecycle of maven? could you tell me the details ?
### 1) Clean
* pre-clean - execute processes needed prior to the actual project cleaning.
* clean - remove all files generated by the previous build.
* post-clean - execute processes needed to finalize the project cleaning.
### 2) prepare-resources
* ?
### 3) default
* validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
* compile - compile the source code of the project
* test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
* package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
* verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
* install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
* deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

### 4) site
* pre-site - execute processes needed prior to the actual project site generation
* site - generate the project's site documentation
* post-site - execute processes needed to finalize the site generation, and to prepare for site deployment
* site-deploy - deploy the generated site documentation to the specified web server

## 12.  What is plugins in maven, list some plugins.
* Plugins are the central feature of Maven that allow for the reuse of common build logic across multiple projects.
* maven-compiler-plugin, maven-surefire-plugin, maven-failsafe-plugin

## 13.  In Repo/MavenProject directory, create a maven Module using Intellij, named it as belows:1.  groupID: com.chuwa.learn  2.  artifactID: java-core 
[MavenProject](../MavenProject).

## 14.  Do Code Review: Go over the PRs in your repo, tried to leave some useful or useful comments in other students' PR, please don't merge it
