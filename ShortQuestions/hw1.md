## 2. What is the basic steps to init a git repo in you local?
1. install git:

3. Initialize the Git Repository:
   ```git init```
4. Add Files to the Repository:
   ```git add .```
5. Commit the Files:
   ```git commit -m "commit message"```

## 3. How to clone a repo from Github?
1. Find the Repository URL. URL can be HTTPS or SSH.
2. Navigate to target Directory: ```cd path/to/project```
3. Clone the Repository: ```git clone repository-url```
4. Navigate to the Cloned Repository: ```cd repository```

## 4. How to create a new branch and checkout to that branch?
```git checkout -b new_branch_name``` or ```git branch new_branch_name; git chechout new_branch_name```.

## 5. How to merge the branch_test to master branch in command? show me the commands
1. Switch to the master Branch: ```git checkout master```
2. Merge branch_test into master: ```git merge branch_test```
3. Option: Handle merge conflicts (if any conflicts): ```git add resolved-file```
4. Option: Commit the merge: ```git commit -m "commit message"```
5. Option: Push the changes to the remote Repository: ```git push origin master```

## 6. How to stash your new code before leaving branch branch_learn_stash and pop your stash when you checkout back to **branch_learn_stash? try commands way and intellij way.
1. Command way
   - Stash your change: ```git stash```
   - Switch to another branch: ```git checkout another_branch```
   - Perform your tasks on the another branch and switch back to branch_learn_stash: ```git checkout branch_learn_stash```
   - Pop the stash to apply your stashed changes: ```git stash pop```
2. Intellij way
   - Stash changes
     - Open the Git tool window: click on View > Tool Windows > Git.
     - Click on the Stash Changes button in the Git tool window.
   - Switch to another branch
     - Select the Branches dropdown in the Git tool window.
     - Select the branch to switch.
   - Switch back to branch_learn_stash
     - Select the Branches dropdown in the Git tool window.
     - Select the branch_learn_stash to switch.
   - Pop Your Stash
     - Click on the Stashes tab in the Git tool window.
     - Right-click on the stash entry created previously and select Apply Stash.

## 7. How do you understand PR is based on Branch?
A Pull Request in Git and GitHub is used to propose changes to a codebase. 
PRs are based on branches. Each feature of the application is developed on a separate branch. 
The changes in a PR are the differences between a branch, where the changes are made, and a branch, where the changes are intended to be merged. 
PR facilitates code review and discussion.

## 8. What is maven role ? what it be used to do?
- Maven role
  - Maven is a build automation and project management tool used in Java projects. It provides a comprehensive and standardized way to manage a project, including build, dependencies, documentation, and reporting.
- Common uses
  - **Build Automation**: Maven automates the process of building and packaging software.
  - **Dependency Management**
  - **Project Management**: Maven provides a standardized project structure and a centralized project configuration (pom.xml).
  - **Lifecycle Management**: Maven defines multiple build phases, such as validation, compilation, testing, packaging, and deployment.

## 9. What is the lifecycle of maven? could you tell me the details?
Maven's lifecycle is a sequence of phases that define the steps in the build and deployment process for a project. There are three main lifecycles in Maven: **Build Lifecycle**, **Clean Lifecycle**, **Site Lifecycle**.
  1. Build Lifecycle: this is the main lifecycle, used to build, test, and deploy a project.
       - validate: Validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available.
       - initialize: Initialize build state, e.g., set properties or create directories.
       - compile: Compile the source code of the project.
       - test: Run tests using a suitable unit testing framework. 
       - package: Take the compiled code and package it into its distributable format, such as a JAR.
       - verify: Run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria.
       - install: Install the package into the local repository.
       - deploy: Copy the final package to the remote repository.
  2. Clean Lifecycle: the clean lifecycle is used to remove all files generated by the previous build.
       - clean: Remove all files generated by the previous build.
  3. Site Lifecycle: the site lifecycle is used to generate project documentation. Its phases are:
       - site: Generate the project's site documentation.
         
## 10. what is the difference between package and install in maven lifecycle?
Key Differences:
1. Functionality:
   - package: Creates the distributable artifact (e.g., JAR, WAR) and places it in the target directory.
   - install: Copies the packaged artifact to the local Maven repository.
2. Lifecycle Execution:
   - package: Executes up to and including the package phase.
   - install: Executes all phases up to and including the install phase, which also includes the package phase.

## 11. What is plugins in maven, list some plugins.
In Maven, plugins are the central mechanism for adding functionality to the build process. 
They are used to perform specific tasks such as compiling code, running tests, packaging code, generating documentation, and deploying artifacts. 
Maven plugins can be bound to different phases of the build lifecycle.  

Common Maven Plugins:
- **maven-compiler-plugin**
- **maven-surefire-plugin**
- **maven-jar-plugin**
- **maven-war-plugin**
- **maven-clean-plugin**
- **maven-deploy-plugin**
- **maven-site-plugin**
