2.  Explain TLS, PKI, certificate, public key, private key, and signature.
TLS (Transport Layer Security): Encrypts communication between a client (browser) and server, ensuring data privacy and integrity.

PKI (Public Key Infrastructure): A system for issuing and managing digital certificates that verify identities of entities (websites, users) online.
Certificate: A digital document containing an entity's public key, bound to its identity, signed by a trusted authority (CA).
Public Key: Used for encryption (anyone can encrypt data with it, but only the private key can decrypt).
Private Key: The counterpart of the public key, kept secret. Used for decryption and digital signatures.
Signature: A mathematical verification attached to data, ensuring it wasn't tampered with and originated from the entity with the private key.

3.  list all http status codes that related to authentication and authorization failures.
401 (Unauthorized): Client lacks valid authentication credentials.
403 (Forbidden): Client is authenticated but lacks authorization to access the resource.

4.  Compare authentication and authorization?
Authentication: Verifies who you are (e.g., login with username/password).
Authorization: Determines what you are allowed to do (e.g., access rights after login).

5.  What is HTTP Session?
Server-side storage of user information during a browsing session.

6.  What is Cookie? 
A small piece of data stored on the client-side (browser) to remember user information across requests.

7.  What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
Sessions are server-side, cookies are client-side.
Sessions can store more data, cookies have size limitations.

8.  How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application? 
Server generates a session ID and stores user data.
A cookie on the client stores the session ID.
The server retrieves user data based on the session ID in the cookie for subsequent requests.

9.  What is JWT?
A self-contained authorization mechanism using a signed JSON object containing user information.

10.  What is the spring security filter?
An interceptor in Spring Security that handles authentication and authorization checks for incoming requests.

11.  Explain how JWT works
Server creates a JWT containing user claims and signs it with a secret key.
Client sends the JWT in the Authorization header of subsequent requests.
Server verifies the JWT's signature and extracts user claims for authorization.

12.  Explain how do we store sensitive user information such as password and credit card number in DB? 
Never store passwords or credit card numbers in plain text!
Use hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) to store one-way encrypted versions.

13.  Compare UserDetailService, AuthenticationProvider, AuthenticationManager, AuthenticationFilter?
UserDetailsService: Loads user information from a data source (e.g., database).
AuthenticationProvider: Performs authentication logic (e.g., verifying credentials against a database).
AuthenticationManager: Central point for authentication, delegating to providers.
AuthenticationFilter: Intercepts requests and triggers authentication.

14.  What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
Disadvantage: Scalability issues (server-side storage).
Solution: Use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) for stateless sessions.

15.  how to get value from application.properties in Spring security?
Use @Value annotation with ${property.name} syntax to inject property values from application.properties.

16.  What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
configure(HttpSecurity http): Defines security configuration for specific URL patterns.
configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth): Configures authentication providers (e.g., for database authentication).

17.  What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
Authentication: Verifies user identity.
Authorization: Decides what resources a user can access based on their roles/permissions.
