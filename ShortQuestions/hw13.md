2. Explain TLS, PKI, certificate, public key, private key, and signature.

   **TLS(Transport Layer Security)**

   - TLS is a protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between two communicating applications.

   - TLS handshake:

     ![TCP 握手](./assets/tls-ssl-handshake.png)

     1. TCP握手：可以看到TCP协议位于传输层和Internet层之间，而TLS协议则位于应用层和传输层之间。越是底部的协议则越基础，越是表面的协议则越接近用户。所以，TCP握手是TLS握手的前提，只有TCP握手成功了才能进行TLS握手。

     2. TLS握手：

        1. **Client Hello**: 由客户端发起，主要包含以下信息：
           1. 客户端生成的随机数x，用于之后的密钥生成
           2. 客户端支持的加密算法列表（Cipher Suites）
           3. TLS版本信息
           4. 客户端支持的压缩算法列表（Compression Methods）
        2. **Server Hello**, **Certificate**, **Server Hello Done**:
           1. 确认使用的加密通信协议版本，比如TLS 1.2版本。如果客户端和服务端支持的版本不一致，服务端关闭加密通信
           2. 服务端生成的随机数y，用于之后的密钥生成
           3. 在客户端发送的加密算法列表里选一个加密算法，比如RSA公钥加密
           4. 服务器CA证书

        3. **Client Key Exchange, Change Cipher Spec, Encrypted Handshake Message**:
           1. 由服务器公钥加密过的随机数z，用于生成服务器的密钥
           2. 编码改变通知，表示随后的信息都将由双方协商的加密方法和密钥发送
           3. 客户端TLS握手结束通知，这一项也是前面发送所有内容的哈希值，用来供服务器校验
        4. **Server Finish**:
           1. 服务端在接收到客户端传来的加密过的随机数z之后，使用自己的私钥对其进行解密获取随机数z，并对数据进行验证。验证无误，用协商好的加密算法和之前的随机数x、y、z产生服务器密钥，它和客户端生成的密钥是一致的，因为此后的加密都是对称加密了。这个过程叫Encrypted Handshake Message。
           2. 等一切完毕之后，会给客户端发送通知，告知客户端已经切换到协商过的加密算法，这个过程叫Change Cipher Spec。

   **PKI**

   - PKI is a framework for managing digital keys and certificates. It enables secure electronic transfer of information for a range of network activities.
   - PKI 包括:
     - 证书颁发机构(Certificate Authority, CA): CA 是负责签发和管理数字证书的实体。它验证申请者的身份，并将其公钥与其身份绑定在一起，生成数字证书。
     - 注册机构(Registration Authority, RA): RA 是 CA 的代理，负责处理证书申请，验证用户身份并将验证结果提交给 CA。
     - 数字证书(Digital Certificate):数字证书是由 CA 颁发的电子文档，包含公钥和持有者的身份信息，并由 CA 的私钥进行签名。
     - 密钥对(Key Pair): 密钥对由公钥和私钥组成，公钥可以公开，私钥必须保密。用于加密和解密、数字签名和验证签名。
   - 工作流程：
     - **申请证书**：用户生成密钥对，并向 RA 提交公钥和身份信息申请证书。
     - **验证身份**：RA 验证申请者的身份，并将结果提交给 CA。
     - **签发证书**：CA 验证通过后，使用其私钥对申请者的公钥和身份信息进行签名，生成数字证书，并将证书返回给申请者。
     - **分发证书**：证书存储库将数字证书存储，并提供查找和下载服务。
     - **使用证书**：受信方在通信过程中使用数字证书进行身份验证和加密。
     - **证书验证**：受信方通过查找证书存储库或使用 OCSP 检查证书的有效性
     - **吊销证书**：如果证书被撤销，CA 将其列入 CRL 或通过 OCSP 提供实时状态信息。

   **Certificate**

   - A digital certificate is an electronic document used to prove the ownership of a public key. Certificates are issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) and contain the public key, the identity of the owner (such as a domain name or individual), and the digital signature of the CA. 

   **Public Key** & **Private Key**

   - Public key 
     - 加密数据，只有私钥持有者可以解密
     - 验证签名，只有私钥持有者的签名可以被验证
   - Private key
     - 解密数据
     - 签名

3. list all the HTTP status codes related to authentication and authorization failures.

   **401 Unauthorized**: This status code indicates that the request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource. The user may have failed to provide the necessary credentials or provided incorrect credentials.

   **403 Forbidden**: This status code means that the server understands the request but refuses to authorize it. This could happen when the user does not have the necessary permissions to access the resource, even if they have provided valid authentication credentials.

   **407 Proxy Authentication Required**: This status code is similar to 401 Unauthorized but indicates that the client must first authenticate itself with the proxy. It is used in scenarios where a proxy server requires authentication before forwarding the request to the target server.

4. Compare authentication and authorization?

   **Authentication**

   - Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that the entity attempting to access a system or resource is who they claim to be.

   **Authorization**

   - Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user or system is allowed to do. It dictates the permissions and access levels granted to the authenticated entity.

   **In Spring Security**

   In Spring Security, authentication and authorization are implemented through a combination of configurations, filters, and annotations. 

   - **Authentication**:

     1. **AuthenticationManager**:

     - This is the main component responsible for processing authentication requests. It delegates the authentication process to one or more `AuthenticationProvider` instances.
     - Commonly configured in a `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` subclass.

     2. **AuthenticationProvider**:

     - This interface performs the actual authentication. An `AuthenticationProvider` retrieves user details (such as username and password) and verifies them.
     - Common implementations include `DaoAuthenticationProvider` which uses a `UserDetailsService` to load user data from a database.

     3. **UserDetailsService**:

     - This interface loads user-specific data. It is used by `DaoAuthenticationProvider` to retrieve user information.
     - Custom implementations of `UserDetailsService` fetch user data from a database or other storage mechanisms.

     4. **Security Configuration**:

     - The `configure` method of `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` is overridden to set up authentication.

   - **Authorization**

     1. **HTTP Security Configuration**:

        - Using the `HttpSecurity` object in the `configure` method to define URL-based authorization rules.

          ```java
          @Override
          protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
              http
                  .authorizeRequests()
                      .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                      .antMatchers("/user/**").hasRole("USER")
                      .antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
                      .anyRequest().authenticated()
                  .and()
                  .formLogin()
                      .loginPage("/login")
                      .permitAll()
                  .and()
                  .logout()
                      .permitAll();
          }
          ```

     2. **Method Security**:

        - Annotations are used to apply security constraints at the method level.

        - Enable method security by adding `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` to your configuration class.

          ```java
          @Configuration
          @EnableWebSecurity
          @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
          public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
              // ...
          }
          ```

        - Use `@PreAuthorize` and `@PostAuthorize` annotations to secure methods.

          ```java
          @Service
          public class MyService {
          
              @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')")
              public void secureMethod() {
                  // secure logic
              }
          }
          ```

     3. **Role-based Access Control**:

        - Roles and authorities are used to control access to different parts of the application.

        - Users are assigned roles, and roles are mapped to specific permissions.

          ```java
          @Override
          protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
              http
                  .authorizeRequests()
                      .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasAuthority("ROLE_ADMIN")
                      .antMatchers("/user/**").hasAuthority("ROLE_USER")
                      .anyRequest().authenticated();
          }
          ```

5. What is HTTP Session?

   An HTTP session is a way to maintain state and track user interactions with a web application across multiple requests and responses. Since HTTP is a stateless protocol, it doesn't retain user data between requests. HTTP sessions help solve this by creating a session object on the server side that can store user-specific data for the duration of the session.

   - A unique identifier assigned to each session. This ID is typically stored in a cookie on the client side.
   - The session ID is sent back to the server with each subsequent request, allowing the server to retrieve the associated session data.

   **In Spring**

   - You can use `HttpSession` to store and retrieve session attributes.

     ```java
     import javax.servlet.http.HttpSession;
     import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
     import org.springframework.ui.Model;
     import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
     import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
     import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
     
     @Controller
     public class SessionController {
     
         @GetMapping("/login")
         public String loginForm() {
             return "login";
         }
     
         @PostMapping("/login")
         public String login(@RequestParam("username") String username, HttpSession session) {
             // Store user information in session
             session.setAttribute("username", username);
             return "redirect:/welcome";
         }
     
         @GetMapping("/welcome")
         public String welcome(HttpSession session, Model model) {
             // Retrieve user information from session
             String username = (String) session.getAttribute("username");
             model.addAttribute("username", username);
             return "welcome";
         }
     
         @GetMapping("/logout")
         public String logout(HttpSession session) {
             // Invalidate the session
             session.invalidate();
             return "redirect:/login";
         }
     }
     /*
     - The login form is displayed at /login.
     - When the user submits the login form, the username is stored in the session.
     - The welcome page retrieves the username from the session and displays it.
     - The logout endpoint invalidates the session, effectively logging the user out. 
     */
     ```

6. What is Cookie?

   A cookie is a small piece of data stored on a user's device by a web browser while browsing a website. Cookies are used to remember information about the user, such as login status, preferences, and other data that can enhance the user experience. 

   **Types of Cookies:**

   - **Session Cookies:** Temporary cookies that are deleted when the browser is closed.
   - **Persistent Cookies:** Remain on the user's device for a set period or until manually deleted.
   - **First-Party Cookies:** Set by the website the user is visiting.
   - **Third-Party Cookies:** Set by a domain other than the one the user is visiting, often used for tracking and advertising purposes.

   **Security and Privacy Concerns:**

   - Cookies can be used to track users across different websites, leading to privacy concerns.
   - Sensitive information stored in cookies should be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Users can manage cookie settings in their browsers, such as blocking third-party cookies or deleting cookies.

   **Cookie Attributes:**

   - **Name:** The name of the cookie.
   - **Value:** The value stored in the cookie.
   - **Domain:** Specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid.
   - **Path:** The URL path for which the cookie is valid.
   - **Expiration:** The date and time when the cookie expires.
   - **Secure:** Indicates if the cookie should only be transmitted over secure (HTTPS) connections.
   - **HttpOnly:** Indicates if the cookie is accessible only through the HTTP protocol, preventing access via JavaScript.

7. Compare session and cookie

   | Feature          | Cookies                                             | Sessions                                       |
   | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
   | Storage Location | Client-side (browser)                               | Server-side                                    |
   | Lifespan         | Can be session-based or persistent                  | Typically last for the session duration        |
   | Security         | Less secure, can be accessed by client-side scripts | More secure, data stored server-side           |
   | Data Capacity    | Limited to around 4KB per cookie                    | Can store larger amounts of data               |
   | Use Cases        | Storing preferences, tracking, remembering login    | Authentication, shopping carts, temporary data |
   | Examples         | Language settings, tracking behavior                | User login status, cart items                  |

8. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the application?

    **Cookie**:  Information about the user, such as login status, preferences are stored in the client's web browser and carried to the server everytime. These information are used across the application.

   **Session**: Information are stored in the server's memory and can be retrieved with sesison id. session identifier is stored on the user's side and is carried to the server.

9. What is JWT?

   JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

   **Structure**:

   - **Header**: Typically consists of two parts: the type of token (JWT) and the signing algorithm being used (e.g., HMAC SHA256 or RSA).
   - **Payload**: Contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims:
     - **Registered claims**: A set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended, to provide a set of useful, interoperable claims. Examples include `iss` (issuer), `exp` (expiration time), `sub` (subject), and `aud` (audience).
     - **Public claims**: These can be defined at will by those using JWTs. To avoid collisions, these should be defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or as a URI that contains a collision-resistant namespace.
     - **Private claims**: Custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them.
   - **Signature**: To create the signature part, you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, and the algorithm specified in the header and sign that.

10. What is the spring security filter?

    Filter can intercept HTTP requests to provide various security functionalities such as authentication, authorization, and other security-related processes. These filters form a filter chain, where each filter performs a specific task in the security workflow.

    - The filter chain consists of a series of filters, each responsible for a specific aspect of security.

    - Filters are processed in a specific order to ensure proper security handling.

    **Common Filters in Spring Security**:

    - **`SecurityContextPersistenceFilter`**: Manages the `SecurityContext` for the current request. This context holds the authentication and security-related information.
    - **`UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`**: Processes authentication requests involving username and password (usually when using form-based login).
    - **`BasicAuthenticationFilter`**: Handles HTTP Basic authentication.
    - **`BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter`**: Handles Bearer token authentication (often used with JWT).
    - **`AuthorizationFilter`**: Checks the user’s roles and permissions to ensure they are allowed to access the requested resource.
    - **`ExceptionTranslationFilter`**: Catches security exceptions and processes them (e.g., redirecting to an error page or returning an appropriate HTTP status code).
    - **`FilterSecurityInterceptor`**: The final filter in the chain that performs security checks on requests to protected resources.

11. Explain how JWT works

    1. **Client Authentication**: The client authenticates with the server using credentials (e.g., username and password). If the authentication is successful, the server issues a JWT.

    2. **Token Storage**: The client stores the JWT, typically in local storage or a cookie.

    3. **Subsequent Requests**: For each subsequent request, the client includes the JWT in the HTTP `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` schema.

    4. **Validation of JWT**:

       The server receives the JWT from the client.

       The server verifies the token’s signature using the secret key to ensure it has not been tampered with.

       The server checks the claims (e.g., expiration time) to ensure the token is still valid.

       If the token is valid, the server extracts the user information from the payload and processes the request.

12. Explain how do we store sensitive user information such as password and credit card number in DB?

    **Storing Passwords**

    1. **Hashing**:

       - **Never store passwords in plaintext**. Always hash passwords before storing them in the database.

       - Use a strong, one-way hashing algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2. These algorithms are designed to be computationally intensive to resist brute-force attacks.

       - Include a unique **salt** for each password. A salt is a random value added to the password before hashing to ensure that even identical passwords have different hashes.

       - Example with bcrypt:

         ```
         java
         Copy code
         import org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder;
         
         BCryptPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
         String hashedPassword = passwordEncoder.encode(rawPassword);
         ```

       - Example with Argon2:

         ```
         java
         Copy code
         import org.springframework.security.crypto.argon2.Argon2PasswordEncoder;
         
         Argon2PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new Argon2PasswordEncoder();
         String hashedPassword = passwordEncoder.encode(rawPassword);
         ```

    2. **Storing Hashes**:

       - Store the hashed password and the salt (if not included in the hash) in the database.
       - Ensure that the hashing algorithm and parameters used (e.g., cost factor) are stored or retrievable to verify the password during authentication.

    **Storing Credit Card Numbers**

    1. **Encryption**:
       - Credit card numbers should be encrypted before storing them in the database.
       - Use strong encryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a key size of at least 256 bits.
       - Ensure the encryption keys are securely managed and stored, using a key management system (KMS) or hardware security module (HSM).
    2. **Tokenization**:
       - Replace the credit card number with a token, a randomly generated string that has no meaningful information.
       - Store the token in the database instead of the actual credit card number.
       - Use a secure tokenization service to convert the token back to the credit card number when needed.
    3. **Compliance**:
       - Adhere to PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) requirements when storing and processing credit card information. This standard provides guidelines for secure storage, encryption, and access control.

    13. Compare UserDetailService, AuthenticationProvider, AuthenticationManager, AuthenticationFilter?

        **UserDetailsService**

        - **Purpose**:
          - Responsible for retrieving user-related data.

        - **Functionality**:

          - It is used to load user-specific data, typically from a database.

          - The core method is `loadUserByUsername(String username)`, which returns a `UserDetails` object.

        - **Implementation**:
          - You usually implement this interface to define how to fetch user details (like username, password, and authorities).

        **AuthenticationProvider**

        - **Purpose**:
          - Responsible for validating the user credentials.

        - **Functionality**:

          - It processes an `Authentication` request and decides whether the user is authenticated or not.

          - It contains the `authenticate(Authentication authentication)` method which performs the actual authentication logic.

          - Typically, it uses a `UserDetailsService` to retrieve user details and then validates the provided credentials.

        - **Implementation**:
          - Multiple `AuthenticationProvider` implementations can be used to support different authentication mechanisms.

        **AuthenticationManager**

        - **Purpose**:

          - The main entry point for authentication.

        - **Functionality**:

          - It delegates the authentication process to one or more `AuthenticationProvider` instances.

          - The `authenticate(Authentication authentication)` method attempts to authenticate the passed `Authentication` object by delegating to the configured `AuthenticationProvider` instances.

        - **Implementation**:
          - Typically, you don't need to implement this directly. Spring Security provides implementations like `ProviderManager` that manage multiple `AuthenticationProvider` instances.

        **AuthenticationFilter**

        - **Purpose**:
          - Intercepts authentication requests and initiates the authentication process.

        - **Functionality**:

          - It captures the credentials (e.g., username and password) from the HTTP request and creates an `Authentication` object.

          - It then passes this `Authentication` object to the `AuthenticationManager` for validation.

          - Common examples include `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter` for form-based login and `BasicAuthenticationFilter` for HTTP Basic authentication.

        - **Implementation**:

          - You can configure or extend existing filters to customize the authentication process.

14. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?

    **Disadvantage:**

    **Scalability**:

    - **Stateful**: Session data is stored on the server, making it stateful. This can cause scalability issues in distributed systems or cloud environments where multiple servers handle requests.
    - **Load Balancing**: Load balancing becomes challenging because the session data needs to be available to whichever server handles the request. This often requires sticky sessions (session affinity) or centralized session storage.

    **Memory Consumption**:

    - **Resource Intensive**: Storing sessions on the server consumes memory and can become a bottleneck as the number of users grows. Each active session occupies server resources, which can degrade performance.

    **Complexity in Session Management**:

    - **Session Replication**: In a clustered environment, session replication is needed to ensure session data is available across all nodes. This adds complexity and overhead.
    - **Session Expiration**: Properly handling session expiration and cleanup can be complex, requiring additional resources and careful configuration to avoid issues such as memory leaks.

    **Security Risks**:

    - **Session Hijacking**: If session IDs are intercepted (e.g., through XSS or insecure transmission), an attacker can hijack the session and impersonate the user.
    - **Session Fixation**: Attackers can force a user to use a known session ID, which they can then hijack.

    ---

    Sulotions:

    **Stateless Authentication with JWT**:

    - **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: JWTs are stateless and do not require server-side session storage. The token contains all the necessary information and is signed to ensure integrity. This eliminates the scalability issues associated with server-side sessions.

    **Centralized Session Store**:

    - **Distributed Cache**: Use a distributed cache like Redis or Memcached to store session data. This centralizes session storage and allows multiple servers to access the same session data, facilitating scalability and load balancing.

    **Enhanced Security Measures**:

    - **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS to encrypt session IDs in transit, preventing interception.
    - **Secure Cookies**: Use the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags for session cookies to mitigate XSS and CSRF attacks.

15. how to get value from application.properties in Spring security?

    **Using `@Value` Annotation**

    ```
    security.jwt.secret=mysecretkey
    security.jwt.expiration=3600
    ```

    ```java
    @Component
    public class JwtConfig {
        
        @Value("${security.jwt.secret}")
        private String jwtSecret;
    
        @Value("${security.jwt.expiration}")
        private int jwtExpirationInMs;
    
        // Getters for the properties
        public String getJwtSecret() {
            return jwtSecret;
        }
    
        public int getJwtExpirationInMs() {
            return jwtExpirationInMs;
        }
    }
    ```

    **Using `Environment` Object**

    ```java
    @Component
    public class JwtConfig {
        
        @Autowired
        private Environment env;
    
        public String getJwtSecret() {
            return env.getProperty("security.jwt.secret");
        }
    
        public int getJwtExpirationInMs() {
            return Integer.parseInt(env.getProperty("security.jwt.expiration", "3600"));
        }
    }
    ```

16. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?

    1. **`configure(HttpSecurity http)`**

    **Role**:

    - This method configures the security of HTTP requests. It allows you to define which endpoints are secured, what types of authentication are required, and other web-related security configurations.

    **Common Configurations**:

    - **Endpoint Protection**: Specify which endpoints are public and which require authentication.
    - **Form Login Configuration**: Configure custom login pages, success, and failure handlers.
    - **HTTP Basic Authentication**: Enable or disable HTTP Basic authentication.
    - **CSRF Protection**: Enable or disable CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.
    - **Session Management**: Configure session creation policies, maximum sessions, etc.
    - **Authorization**: Define role-based access control for different endpoints.
    - **Custom Filters**: Add custom filters to the security filter chain.

    ```java
    @Configuration
    @EnableWebSecurity
    public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    
        @Override
        protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
            http
                .csrf().disable() // Disable CSRF protection for simplicity
                .authorizeRequests()
                    .antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll() // Public endpoints
                    .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN") // Admin endpoints
                    .anyRequest().authenticated() // All other endpoints require authentication
                    .and()
                .formLogin()
                    .loginPage("/login") // Custom login page
                    .permitAll() // Allow everyone to access the login page
                    .and()
                .logout()
                    .permitAll(); // Allow everyone to logout
        }
    }
    ```

    **configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)**

    **Role**:

    - This method configures the authentication mechanisms. It is used to define how users are authenticated and where their credentials are stored (e.g., in-memory, database, LDAP).

    **Common Configurations**:

    - **In-Memory Authentication**: Define a set of users and their roles in-memory.

    - **JDBC Authentication**: Use a database to store user credentials and roles.

    - **LDAP Authentication**: Integrate with an LDAP server for authentication.

    - **Custom Authentication Provider**: Use a custom authentication provider to implement complex authentication logic.

    - **Password Encoder**: Specify the password encoder for hashing passwords.

      ```java
      @Configuration
      @EnableWebSecurity
      public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
      
          @Override
          protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
              auth
                  .inMemoryAuthentication()
                      .withUser("user").password(passwordEncoder().encode("password")).roles("USER")
                      .and()
                      .withUser("admin").password(passwordEncoder().encode("admin")).roles("ADMIN");
          }
      
          @Bean
          public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
              return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
          }
      }
      ```

    **How They Work Together**

    - **HttpSecurity**: Manages how HTTP requests are secured. It deals with the overall security of the web application, determining how different URL patterns are protected, configuring login forms, handling CSRF, session management, etc.

    - **AuthenticationManagerBuilder**: Configures the `AuthenticationManager` with authentication providers. It deals with user authentication by setting up user details services, password encoders, and custom authentication providers.

      ```java
      @Configuration
      @EnableWebSecurity
      public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
      
          @Override
          protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
              http
                  .csrf().disable()
                  .authorizeRequests()
                      .antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
                      .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                      .anyRequest().authenticated()
                      .and()
                  .formLogin()
                      .loginPage("/login")
                      .permitAll()
                      .and()
                  .logout()
                      .permitAll();
          }
      
          @Override
          protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
              auth
                  .inMemoryAuthentication()
                      .withUser("user").password(passwordEncoder().encode("password")).roles("USER")
                      .and()
                      .withUser("admin").password(passwordEncoder().encode("admin")).roles("ADMIN");
          }
      
          @Bean
          public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
              return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
          }
      }
      ```

      In this example:

      - `configure(HttpSecurity http)` secures HTTP requests, defines public and protected endpoints, and configures form login.
      - `configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)` sets up in-memory authentication with users and their roles.
      - A `PasswordEncoder` bean is defined to encode passwords.

17. What is Spring security authentication and authorization? 

    I have compared this in Q4.
