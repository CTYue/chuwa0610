# Chuwa Homework12 MingHao (Howard) Lee

## 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
- Refer to the annotation.md 

## 2. What is MVC pattern?
# MVC Pattern Detailed Summary

### Key Points:

#### Controller:
- **Responsibilities**: Maps incoming client requests to specific handlers.
- **Contains Business Logic**: Manages the core functionality and business rules of the application.
- **Data Processing**: Handles tasks like reading form data, accessing databases, or invoking web services.
- **Model Interaction**: Creates and populates the model with the necessary data.
- **Returns Model**: Sends the populated model back to the front controller.

#### Model:
- **Data Container**: Stores data temporarily for the application's needs.
- **Data Transfer**: Used to pass data between the controller and view.
- **Population**: Filled with data by the controller from various sources (forms, databases, web services).
- **Flow**: Passed from the controller to the front controller, then to the view resolver.

#### View (Template):
- **Display Logic**: Presents data to the user in a structured and formatted manner.
- **Technologies Supported**: JSP, JSTL, Thymeleaf, Groovy, Velocity, FreeMarker.
- **Data Reading**: Retrieves data from the model to display.
- **User Interaction**: Creates the visual interface for user interaction.

### Advantages:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct layers (controller, model, view) each handle specific responsibilities.
- **Flexible View Technology**: Allows developers to choose from various view technologies without impacting the controller or model.
- **Testability**: The framework supports Test Driven Development (TDD) by isolating components for testing.
- **Data Binding and Validation**: Uses Spring tag library for automatic data binding and validation.
- **WebApplicationContext**: Scopes beans to HTTP requests or sessions, making it easier to track web requests.

### Logic Flow:

#### Client Request:
- The client sends an HTTP request to the server.

#### Front Controller (DispatcherServlet):
- Receives the incoming request.
- Determines the appropriate controller to handle the request based on the URL mapping.

#### Controller:
- Processes the request.
- Performs necessary actions such as reading input data, interacting with the model (e.g., querying the database), and applying business logic.
- Creates a model object containing the response data.

#### Front Controller:
- Receives the model from the controller.
- Forwards the model to the view resolver for rendering.

#### View Resolver:
- Determines which view template (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf) should be used based on the view name.
- Passes the model data to the selected view template.

#### View Template:
- Reads the model data.
- Renders the data into a user-friendly format, typically HTML.
- Prepares the final view for the user.

#### Response to Client:
- The front controller sends the rendered view (HTML response) back to the client.



## 3. What is Front-Controller?
The Front Controller is a design pattern used in web applications to handle all incoming requests through a single handler. In the context of Spring MVC, the `DispatcherServlet` acts as the front controller. It routes requests to the appropriate controllers, processes user inputs, manages the application flow, and ensures responses are returned to the client. This centralizes request handling and promotes a clear separation of concerns.
- **Centralized Request Handling**: Receives all incoming HTTP requests and directs them to the appropriate controller.
- **DispatcherServlet in Spring MVC**: Acts as the front controller in Spring MVC.
- **Request Delegation**: Maps requests to specific controllers based on URL patterns.
- **Model Handling**: Receives the model from controllers and forwards it to the view resolver.
- **Response Coordination**: Ensures the rendered view is returned as the HTTP response to the client.


## 4. What is DispatcherServlet? please describe how it works.
### DispatcherServlet Description
`DispatcherServlet` is the front controller in Spring MVC that handles all incoming HTTP requests and dispatches them to the appropriate handlers/controllers. It acts as a central dispatcher to control the entire request handling process.

### How DispatcherServlet Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - Configured in `web.xml` or through Java configuration.
   - On application startup, it reads configuration files (e.g., `applicationContext.xml`).

2. **Request Handling**:
   - Receives all HTTP requests to the application.
   - Determines the appropriate handler based on URL mapping.

3. **Request Processing**:
   - Invokes the corresponding controller to handle the request.
   - Controller processes the request, interacts with the model, and returns a view name and model.

4. **View Resolution**:
   - Uses `ViewResolver` to determine the view template.
   - Passes the model to the view for rendering.

5. **Response**:
   - Renders the view and returns the HTTP response to the client.


## 5. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView? (please google to have a basic knowledge)
### JSP (JavaServer Pages)

JSP is a server-side technology used for creating dynamic web content. It allows embedding Java code in HTML pages to generate dynamic content based on user requests and interactions. JSP files are compiled into servlets by the server and executed to produce the final HTML sent to the client's browser.

### ModelAndView

`ModelAndView` is a class in Spring MVC that holds both the model (data) and the view (UI template) for a web request. It allows the controller to return both the model and view name in a single object, simplifying the request handling process.

### Condensed Answers for Interview

#### JSP:
- Server-side technology.
- Embeds Java in HTML for dynamic web content.

#### ModelAndView:
- Holds model (data) and view (UI template).
- Simplifies returning both data and view from controllers in Spring MVC.


## 6. Could you please google any other servlets (理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间，知道servlet的名字就行。)
### Types of Servlets
1. **GenericServlet:**
    - **Protocol-independent base class** for creating servlets.
    - Can be used with any protocol (HTTP, FTP, SMTP).
    - Implements basic lifecycle methods like `init()` and `destroy()`.

2. **HttpServlet:**
    - Specialized for handling HTTP requests.
    - Extends `GenericServlet`.
    - Provides methods like `doGet()`, `doPost()`, `doPut()`, and `doDelete()`.

## 7. How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)
1. **Tomcat:**
    - An open-source Java Servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation.
    - Commonly used for running Java Servlets and JSP.

2. **Jetty:**
    - An open-source project providing a lightweight and flexible web server.
    - Often used in embedded systems and supports various protocols.

3. **JBoss (WildFly):**
    - An open-source application server developed by Red Hat.
    - Supports the full Java EE stack and is used for building enterprise applications.


## 8. clone this repo, and run it in you local.
   1. [https://github.com/CTYue/springmvc5-demo](https://github.com/CTYue/springmvc5-demo)
   2. Notice that you need to configure the Tomcat by yourself. tutorial in the slides.
   3. find out the APIs in controller and call some APIs, In slides, I also list some API.
   4. remember to create a database for this project
   5. all details in the slides.
