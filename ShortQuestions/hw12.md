2.  What is MVC pattern?
Model: Represents the data and the business logic of the application. It directly manages the data, logic, and rules of the application.
View: Represents the UI components (like HTML, CSS, etc.) that display the data.
Controller: Acts as an intermediary between Model and View. It listens to user input, processes it (using the Model), and updates the View accordingly.

3.  What is Front-Controller? 
The Front-Controller pattern is a design pattern in web applications where a single controller handles all requests for a web application. This controller delegates the request to other controllers or actions based on the request URL and other parameters. This pattern centralizes request handling, reducing code duplication and improving manageability.

4.  What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.
DispatcherServlet is a central component of the Spring MVC framework. It acts as a front-controller and is responsible for handling all incoming web requests. Here's how it works:

(a) Initialization: When the Spring application starts, DispatcherServlet is initialized and configured through web.xml or Java configuration.
(b) Request Handling: When a request is made to the server, DispatcherServlet receives it.
(c) Request Mapping: It uses handler mappings to determine the appropriate controller to handle the request.
(d) Controller Execution: The matched controller processes the request and returns a ModelAndView object.
(e) View Resolution: DispatcherServlet uses a view resolver to map the logical view name to an actual view (e.g., a JSP file).
(f) Response Rendering: Finally, the view is rendered and the response is sent back to the client.

5.  What is JSP and What is ModelAndViewï¼Ÿ
JSP (JavaServer Pages): JSP is a server-side technology that allows for the creation of dynamic, platform-independent web pages using Java. It allows embedding Java code in HTML pages using special tags, facilitating the creation of web-based applications.
ModelAndView: ModelAndView is a class in the Spring MVC framework that holds both the model and the view. The model contains the data to be displayed on the view, and the view is the name of the view (such as a JSP page) that will be used to render the model data. The controller returns a ModelAndView object to DispatcherServlet to process the request further.

6.  Could you please google any other servlets
HttpServlet: Provides methods to handle HTTP requests such as doGet, doPost, doPut, doDelete, etc.
GenericServlet: A protocol-independent servlet that extends the Servlet interface.
ServletConfig: Used to pass configuration information to a servlet during initialization.
ServletContext: Provides information about the servlet's environment and allows communication between servlets.

7.  How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)
Tomcat: An open-source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, and Java Expression Language technologies.
Jetty: An open-source project providing an HTTP server, HTTP client, and javax.servlet container.
JBoss (WildFly): An application server authored by JBoss, now developed by Red Hat, used for implementing Java applications and other software based on Java.
GlassFish: An open-source application server project led by Oracle Corporation for the Java EE platform.
WebSphere: A set of Java-based tools from IBM that allows customers to create and manage sophisticated business websites.
