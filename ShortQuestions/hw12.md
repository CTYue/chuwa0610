## 2.  What is MVC pattern?
* The Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern specifies that an application consists of a data model, presentation information, and control information. The pattern requires that each of these be separated into different objects.
* Model: The Model component in the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern represents the data and business logic of an application. It is responsible for managing the application's data, processing business rules, and responding to requests for information from other components, such as the View and the Controller.
* View: Displays the data from the Model to the user and sends user inputs to the Controller. It is passive and does not directly interact with the Model. Instead, it receives data from the Model and sends user inputs to the Controller for processing.
* Controller: Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles user input and updates the Model accordingly and updates the View to reflect changes in the Model. It contains application logic, such as input validation and data transformation.

## 3.  What is Front-Controller? 
* The front controller design pattern means that all requests that come for a resource in an application will be handled by a single handler and then dispatched to the appropriate handler for that type of request. The front controller may use other helpers to achieve the dispatching mechanism.

## 4.  What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.
* Spring MVC, as many other web frameworks, is designed around the front controller pattern where a central Servlet, the DispatcherServlet, provides a shared algorithm for request processing, while actual work is performed by configurable delegate components. This model is flexible and supports diverse workflows.
* The DispatcherServlet, as any Servlet, needs to be declared and mapped according to the Servlet specification by using Java configuration or in web.xml. In turn, the DispatcherServlet uses Spring configuration to discover the delegate components it needs for request mapping, view resolution, exception handling, and more.

## 5.  What is JSP and What is ModelAndView? (please google to have a basic knowlege)
* In Java, JSP stands for Jakarta Server Pages( (JSP; formerly JavaServer Pages)). It is a server-side technology which is used for creating web applications. It is used to create dynamic web content. JSP consists of both HTML tags and JSP tags. In this, JSP tags are used to insert JAVA code into HTML pages. It is an advanced version of Servlet Technology i.e. a web-based technology that helps us to create dynamic and platform-independent web pages. In this, Java code can be inserted in HTML/ XML pages or both. JSP is first converted into a servlet by the JSP container before processing the client’s request. JSP has various features like JSP Expressions, JSP tags, JSP Expression Language, etc.
* ModelAndView is a class present in org.springframework.web.servlet package. ModelAndView is a value object designed to hold model and view making it possible for a handler to return both model and view in a single return value. ModelAndView is resolved by DispatcherServlet using special framework objects ViewResolver and View.

## 6.  Could you please google any other servlets(理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间，知道servlet的名字就行。)
Generic servlets: Extend javax.servlet.GenericServlet. Contain no inherent HTTP support or any other transport protocol, so that protocol is independent.
HTTP servlets: Extend javax.servlet.HttpServlet, Contain built-in HTTP protocol support and are more useful in a Sun Java System Web Server 7.0 environment.

##  7.  How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)
* Tomcat, Jetty, resin, Oracle Application server, WebLogic Server, Glassfish, Websphere, JBoss
