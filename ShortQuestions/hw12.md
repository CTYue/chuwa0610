1. **Explain following concepts:**
    1. **Docker daemon**
    2. **Docker host**
    3. **Docker Registry**
    4. **Image/Image Tag**
    5. **Container Volume**
    6. **Docker Namespace**

Docker daemon: The server-side component of the docker engine that runs as a background process on the host system. The daemon establishes a connection with the docker registry.

Docker host: The component has main docker daemon and hosts container and their associated images.

Docker register: The component stores the docker images, it can be a public registry or a private one.

Image/Image Tag: docker images are executable packages(bundled with application code& dependencies, software packages..etc)

Image Tag is the tag to identify the image.

```java
[registry]/[repository]:[tag]
```

Container: A running instance of a docker image.

Volume: Used to persisting and managing data generated by user or by docker containers. It allow you to separate the data from the containerâ€™s lifecycle, enable you to persist data even after the container has been stopped or removed. Docker volumes are useful for sharing data between containers and for storing data that must be retained across container restarts. 

Docker Namespace: In docker, the name spaces introduce a layer of isolation amongst the containers, which ensure the container are portable and not affect the underlying host.
