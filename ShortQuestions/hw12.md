2. What is MVC pattern?

   The MVC pattern refers to Model-View-Controller patter.

   - Model is a container for data. It is used to transfer data from one part of the MVC application to another.
   - Controller handles the user requests and populates the model with data from a data source (such as a form, database or a webservice). The controller passes the model to the front controller which forwards it again to the view resolver.
   - View (Template) receives the model containing data. It reads the model and displays the data. Spring MVC supports a number of view templates such as JSP or JSTL.

3. What is Front-Controller?

   The main handler that receives all requests for a web application. It processes the requests and forwards them to the appropriate handler or view. `DispatcherServlet` is the Front-Controller in Spring MVC.

4. What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.

   1. Web server receives Http Requests and handle it to `DispatcherServlet`.
   2. `DispatcherServlet` calls `HandlerMapper`  to find the corresponding Controller to handle the request. `HandlerMapper` returns the controller and method to `DispatcherServlet`.
   3. `DispatcherServlet` calls the method in the right controller and controller calls service then retrieve data from database (or do operations). 
   4. Result (`ModelAndView`) will be put in to model by Controller and then returned to `DispatcherServlet`. 
   5. `DispatcherServlet` calls the ViewResolver with the view name.
   6. `ViewResolver` will find the corresponding view template.
   7. `ViewEngine` will generate html witl the view template and the model.
   8. Html will be returned to client by `DispatcherServlet`

5. What is JSP and what is ModelAndView?

   **JSP**

   - **Definition**: JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology used for creating dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types. It is a part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform.

   - **Purpose**:

     - JSP allows developers to embed Java code in HTML pages to generate dynamic content.
     - It simplifies the creation of web pages that interact with Java backend code.

   - **Key Features**:

     - Scripting Elements

       : Allows embedding Java code directly in the HTML.

       - **Declarations**: `<%! ... %>` for declaring variables and methods.
       - **Scriptlets**: `<% ... %>` for embedding Java code in the HTML.
       - **Expressions**: `<%= ... %>` for outputting the value of an expression to the client.

     - Directives

       : Instructions that apply globally to the entire JSP page.

       - **Page Directive**: `<%@ page ... %>` to define page-specific attributes like import statements, error pages, etc.
       - **Include Directive**: `<%@ include file="..." %>` to include other resources.
       - **Taglib Directive**: `<%@ taglib ... %>` to declare a tag library containing custom tags.

     - **Custom Tags and Tag Libraries**: Extends the capabilities of JSP using reusable components.

     - **Expression Language (EL)**: A simpler syntax to access application data stored in JavaBeans components, request parameters, session attributes, etc.

   - Example:

     ```jsp
     <%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" pageEncoding="UTF-8"%>
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
         <title>Hello JSP</title>
     </head>
     <body>
         <h1>Hello, <%= request.getParameter("name") %>!</h1>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

   **ModelAndView**

   - **Definition**: `ModelAndView` is a class in Spring MVC that holds both the model and the view. It is used to pass data from the controller to the view and to specify which view should be rendered.

   - **Purpose**:

     - **Model**: Contains the data that needs to be rendered on the view. It is a map of key-value pairs.
     - **View**: Specifies the view name or the view object that should render the model data.

   - **Key Features**:

     - **Model**: A map that contains data attributes that are passed to the view for rendering.
     - **View Name**: A string that specifies the name of the view that should render the model.
     - **Chaining Methods**: Methods like `addObject` to add attributes to the model.

   - **Example**:

     ```java
     @Controller
     public class ExampleController {
     
         @RequestMapping("/example")
         public ModelAndView handleRequest() {
             ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView();
             mav.setViewName("exampleView"); // Name of the view (e.g., a JSP page)
             mav.addObject("message", "Hello, World!"); // Add data to the model
             return mav;
         }
     }
     ```

     exampleView.jsp:

     ```jsp
     <%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" pageEncoding="UTF-8"%>
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
         <title>Example View</title>
     </head>
     <body>
         <h1>${message}</h1> <!-- Access the "message" attribute from the model -->
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

6. Other servlets

   - **HttpServlet**

     `HttpServlet` is the most common type of servlet and is designed to handle HTTP requests. It provides methods to handle different types of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). 

     **Usage:**

     - Used for processing HTTP requests and generating HTTP responses.
     - Most web applications use `HttpServlet` to interact with clients via HTTP.

     **Key Methods**:

     - `doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)`: Handles HTTP GET requests.
     - `doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)`: Handles HTTP POST requests.
     - `doPut(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)`: Handles HTTP PUT requests.
     - `doDelete(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)`: Handles HTTP DELETE requests.

   - **GenericServlet**

     **Definition**: `GenericServlet` is an abstract class that implements the `Servlet` interface. It provides simple versions of the lifecycle methods `init` and `destroy` and a default implementation of `getServletConfig` and `getServletInfo`.

     **Usage**:

     - Used as a base class for creating protocol-independent servlets.
     - Requires the developer to implement the `service` method.

     **Key Methods**:

     - `service(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res)`: Must be overridden to handle requests.

     **Example**:

     ```java
     public class ExampleGenericServlet extends GenericServlet {
         public void service(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
             response.setContentType("text/html");
             PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
             out.println("<html><body>");
             out.println("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>");
             out.println("</body></html>");
           //response will be sent back to client directly.
         }
     }
     ```

7. How many web server do you know?

   **Lightweight Containers**: Apache Tomcat, Jetty, and Apache TomEE are suitable for lightweight applications where full Java EE support is not necessary.

   **Full Java EE Support**: JBoss (WildFly), GlassFish, WebSphere, and WebLogic provide comprehensive support for Java EE, making them ideal for enterprise-level applications.

   **Enterprise-Level Features**: WebSphere and WebLogic offer extensive features for enterprise environments, including advanced security, clustering, and integration capabilities.

   **Performance**: Resin and WebLogic are known for their high performance and scalability, making them suitable for high-traffic applications.
