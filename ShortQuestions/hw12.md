## 2. What is MVC pattern?
Spring MVC Framework follows the Model-View-Controller architectural design pattern which works around the Front Controller i.e. the Dispatcher Servlet. The Dispatcher Servlet handles and dispatches all the incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controller. It uses `@Controller` and `@RequestMapping` as default request handlers. The `@Controller` annotation defines that a particular class is a controller. `@RequestMapping` annotation maps web requests to Spring Controller methods.
- **Model**: The model encapsulates the application data.
- **View**: View renders the model data and generates HTML output that the client's browser can interpret.
- **Controller**: The Controller processes the user requests and passes them to the view for rendering.

## 3. What is Front-Controller?
As the name suggests, when any web requests are made, the requests will come first to the front Controller which is nothing but the Dispatcher Servlet. The Front Controller stands first that is why itâ€™s name is like this. After the requests comes into this, the dispatcher servlet accepts the requests and decides which controller will be suitable to handle these requests. Then it dispatches the HTTP requests to specific controller.

## 4. What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.
Dispatcher Servlet is the front controller that manages the entire HTTP request and response handling process.  
Work flow of DispatcherServlet:
1. All the incoming requests are intercepted by the DispatcherServlet that works as the front controller.
2. The DispatcherServlet then gets an entry of handler mapping from the XML file and forwards the request to the controller.
3. The object of ModelAndView is returned by the controller.
4. The DispatcherServlet checks the entry of the view resolver in the XML file and invokes the appropriate view component.

## 5. What is JSP and What is Model And View?(please google to have a basic knowlege)
JSP is a templating mechanism for HTML pages when building web applications.  
Model encapsulates the application data.  
View renders the model data and generates HTML output that the client's browser can interpret.

## 6. Could you please google any other servlets
- `ServletWrappingController`: Wraps a standard servlet as a Spring MVC controller. This allows legacy servlets to be integrated into a Spring MVC application, enabling their use alongside modern Spring controllers.
- `HttpServletBean`: A base class for servlets in Spring, providing integration with the Spring application context. It facilitates easy access to configuration properties and beans managed by Spring.
- `FrameworkServlet`: A superclass for `DispatcherServlet`, providing integration with the Spring application context. It manages the lifecycle of a web application context and provides core functionality for handling requests.
- `SpringServletContainerInitializer`: An initializer that sets up the Spring context in a Servlet 3.0+ environment. It ensures that Spring is properly initialized when the servlet container starts.
- `HttpPutFormContentFilter`: A servlet filter that processes form content in PUT requests. It makes form data available to the request parameters map, similar to how it works for POST requests.

## 7. How many web server do you know?(Tomcat,Jetty,Jboss)
- **Tomcat**: Apache Tomcat is an open-source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and Java Expression Language (EL) technologies. It provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment in which Java code can run. Tomcat is widely used due to its simplicity, lightweight nature, and ease of integration with various Java frameworks, including Spring Boot.
- **Jetty**: Jetty is an open-source web server and servlet container developed by Eclipse Foundation. It is known for its scalability, performance, and flexibility. Jetty can be embedded in Java applications, making it a popular choice for developers who need a lightweight, fast, and embeddable web server. It supports HTTP/2, WebSockets, and other modern web protocols.
- **JBoss(WildFly)**: JBoss, now known as WildFly, is a free, open-source application server developed by Red Hat. It implements the full Java EE (Enterprise Edition) stack, providing a robust environment for deploying enterprise Java applications. WildFly supports a wide range of technologies and standards, including EJB, JPA, JAX-RS, and CDI. It's known for its modular architecture and high performance.
- **GlassFish**: GlassFish is an open-source application server project initiated by Sun Microsystems for the Java EE platform. Now maintained by the Eclipse Foundation, it provides a robust, enterprise-grade platform for deploying Java EE applications. GlassFish is known for its compliance with Java EE standards, developer-friendly features, and support for modern enterprise features.
- **Apache HTTP Server (httpd)**: Apache HTTP Server, commonly referred to as Apache httpd, is an open-source web server created by the Apache Software Foundation. While not a Java server per se, it is often used in conjunction with Java servers (like Tomcat) to serve static content, perform load balancing, or act as a reverse proxy.
- **Undertow**: Undertow is a flexible, performant web server written in Java, developed by JBoss. It is designed to be lightweight and embeddable, supporting non-blocking and blocking APIs. Undertow is often used as the underlying server in WildFly and can be easily integrated into applications for high-performance HTTP handling.
- **Oracle WebLogic**: Oracle WebLogic Server is a Java EE application server developed by Oracle Corporation. It provides a highly scalable, secure, and reliable platform for developing and deploying enterprise Java applications. WebLogic supports a broad range of enterprise features, including clustering, caching, and advanced security mechanisms.
