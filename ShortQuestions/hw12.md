## 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md

## 2. What is MVC pattern?

- The MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern is a design pattern used for developing user interfaces that divides an application into three interconnected components:
    - Model: Manages the data and business logic.
    - View: Displays the data (UI).
    - Controller: Handles user input and updates the Model and View accordingly.

## 3. What is Front-Controller?

- The Front-Controller is a design pattern used in web applications where a single handler (controller) processes all incoming requests. It centralizes request handling, delegating to appropriate handlers for processing, improving manageability and consistency.

- In Java, DispatcherServlet in Spring MVC is an example of a Front-Controller.

## 4. What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works？

- DispatcherServlet is the front controller in Spring MVC. It handles all incoming HTTP requests and dispatches them to appropriate handlers (controllers).

- How it works:
    - Receives Request: Captures all requests through a common entry point.
    - Dispatches Request: Uses handler mappings to find the right controller.
    - Calls Controller: Invokes the controller's method to process the request.
    - Handles Response: Returns a ModelAndView object, which includes the view name and model data.
    - Renders View: Delegates to a view resolver to render the final output (e.g., HTML).

## 5. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView？(please google to have a basic knowlege).

- JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a technology that allows the creation of dynamic web pages using a combination of HTML, XML, and Java code. JSP pages are executed on a server, and the resulting output is sent to the client's web browser. This enables developers to embed Java code directly into HTML pages, making it easier to create and manage dynamic web content. JSP is typically used in conjunction with servlets to handle data processing and client requests​ (TutorialsPoint)​​ (W3Schools)​.

- ModelAndView is a Spring framework class that holds both the model and the view in a web MVC application. It is used to return both model data and view name from a controller to the view resolver. Here's how it works:
    - Model: Holds data to be displayed in the view (usually a map of key-value pairs).
    - View: Specifies the name of the view (e.g., a JSP page) to be rendered​ (W3Schools)​.
    - This separation allows for a clean separation of concerns in the MVC pattern, making the application easier to manage and maintain.

## 6. Could you please google any other servlets(理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间，知道servlet的名字就⾏。)

- HttpServlet: A base class for creating HTTP servlets. It simplifies handling HTTP requests by providing methods like doGet() and doPost().

- GenericServlet: A protocol-independent servlet class that implements the Servlet interface. It can be extended to create servlets that handle protocols other than HTTP.

- FileUploadServlet: Manages file uploads from client to server using libraries like Apache Commons FileUpload.

- SessionTrackingServlet: Handles session management to maintain user state across multiple requests.

## 7. How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)

- Apache Tomcat: An open-source implementation of Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, and Java Expression Language technologies.
- Jetty: A lightweight, highly scalable web server and servlet container.
- JBoss: Part of the WildFly project, it is a flexible, open-source application server.
- Apache HTTP Server: A widely-used open-source web server.
- Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services): A web server created by Microsoft for use with Windows.

## 8. clone this repo, and run it in you local.

### 1. https://github.com/CTYue/springmvc5-demo
### 2. Notice that you need to configure the Tomcat by yourself. tutorial in the slides.
### 3. find out the APIs in controlelr and call some APIs, In slides, I also list some API.
### 4. remeber to create a database for this project
### 5. all details in the slides.
