2. What is MVC pattern? 

   >MVC is short for model, view, and controller.
   >
   >**Controller**: The front controller maps the incoming request to a controller. The controller returns the model (containing data) back to the front controller.
   >
   >**Model**: Model is a container for data. It is used to transfer data from one part of the Spring MVC application to another
   >
   >**View (Template)**: View template receives the model containing data. It reads the model and displays the data. 

3. What is Front-Controller? 

   >The **front controller** [software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) is listed in several pattern catalogs and is related to the design of web applications. It is "a [controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller) that handles all requests for a [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website),"[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_controller#cite_note-:0-1) which is a useful structure for web application developers to achieve flexibility and reuse without code redundancy.

4. What is DispatcherServlet? please describe how it works. 

   >Font-controller is DispatcherServlet. DispatcherServlet abstracts away the following tedious and boilerplate tasks and focuses on useful business logic:
   >
   >+ Mapping an HTTP request to a certain processing method 
   >+ Parsing of HTTP request data and headers into data transfer objects (DTOs)or domain objects 
   >+ Model-view-controller interaction 
   >+ Generation of responses from DTOs, domain objects, etc.

5. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView？(please google to have a basic knowlege) 

   >JSP:
   >
   >In Java, **JSP** stands for **Jakarta Server Pages**. It is a server-side technology which is used for creating web applications. It is used to create dynamic web content. JSP consists of both HTML tags and JSP tags. In this, JSP tags are used to insert JAVA code into HTML pages. It is an advanced version of **Servlet** Technology i.e. a web-based technology that helps us to create dynamic and platform-independent web pages. In this, Java code can be inserted in HTML/ XML pages or both. JSP is first converted into a servlet by the JSP container before processing the client’s request. JSP has various features like JSP Expressions, JSP tags, JSP Expression Language, etc.
   >
   >ModelAndView: 
   >
   >1. Holder for both Model and View in the web MVC framework. Note that these are entirely distinct. This class merely holds both to make it possible for a controller to return both model and view in a single return value.
   >2. Represents a model and view returned by a handler, to be resolved by a DispatcherServlet. The view can take the form of a String view name which will need to be resolved by a ViewResolver object; alternatively a View object can be specified directly. The model is a Map, allowing the use of multiple objects keyed by name.

6. Could you please google any other servlets(理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间，知道servlet的名字就⾏。)

   >**GenericServlet** class implements **Servlet**, **ServletConfig** and **Serializable** interfaces. It provides the implementation of all the methods of these interfaces except the service method.
   >
   >The HttpServlet class extends the GenericServlet class and implements Serializable interface. It provides http-specific methods such as doGet, doPost, doHead, doTrace etc.

7. How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss) 

   >Tomcat
   >
   >Jetty 
   >
   >GlassFish 
   >
   >WildFly
   >
   >https://stackify.com/tomcat-vs-jetty-vs-glassfish-vs-wildfly/

8. clone this repo, and run it in you local. 

   1. https://github.com/CTYue/springmvc5-demo 
   2. Notice that you need to configure the Tomcat by yourself. tutorial in the slides. 
   3. find out the APIs in controlelr and call some APIs, In slides, I also list some API. 
   4. remeber to create a database for this project 
   5. all details in the slides
