1. 
#### @GetMapping - R (Read)

**Description**: The `@GetMapping` annotation is used to map HTTP GET requests onto specific handler methods. It is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)`.

#### @PutMapping - U (Update)
Description: The @PutMapping annotation is used to map HTTP PUT requests onto specific handler methods. It is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PUT).

#### @PostMapping - C (Create)
Description: The @PostMapping annotation is used to map HTTP POST requests onto specific handler methods. It is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST).

#### @DeleteMapping - D (Delete)
Description: The @DeleteMapping annotation is used to map HTTP DELETE requests onto specific handler methods. It is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.DELETE).

#### @RequestMapping(method=RequestMethod.GET)
Description: The @RequestMapping annotation is used to map web requests onto specific handler methods or classes. When specifying the method attribute, it narrows the mapping to a specific HTTP method.

#### @RestController
Description: The @RestController annotation is a special controller used in Spring MVC to handle RESTful web services. It is a convenience annotation that combines @Controller and @ResponseBody. All handler methods in a class annotated with @RestController will return JSON or XML responses directly without the need for @ResponseBody on each method.

#### @Controller
Description: The @Controller annotation is used to define a web controller in Spring MVC. It is used to handle web requests and return views. Methods in a class annotated with @Controller typically return view names, and the response body can be returned by using the @ResponseBody annotation.

### Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces. It divides an application into three interconnected components, facilitating a clear division of responsibilities.

#### Components of MVC

##### Model
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Represents the application's data and business logic.
    - Manages the data, logic, and rules of the application.
    - Notifies the view of any changes to the data.
- **Examples**:
    - Classes representing business entities (e.g., User, Product).
    - Data access objects (DAOs) that interact with the database.
    - Service classes that contain business logic.

##### View
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Represents the UI (User Interface) of the application.
    - Displays data from the model to the user.
    - Sends user commands to the controller.
- **Examples**:
    - HTML, JSP, Thymeleaf templates in a web application.
    - GUI components in a desktop application.

##### Controller
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Handles user input and interactions.
    - Interprets the input and transforms it into actions to be performed by the model or view.
    - Updates the model based on user input and updates the view accordingly.
- **Examples**:
    - Servlet controllers in a web application.
    - Action listeners in a desktop application.

#### Flow of Control in MVC

1. **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the view (e.g., clicks a button, enters data).
2. **View to Controller**: The view sends the user's input to the controller.
3. **Controller to Model**: The controller processes the input, possibly making changes to the model.
4. **Model Update**: The model updates its state based on the controller's actions.
5. **Model to View**: The model notifies the view of any state changes.
6. **View Update**: The view queries the model for the latest data and updates the UI to reflect the changes.



3. 
The Front Controller design pattern is a common pattern used in web applications to provide a centralized entry point for handling requests. The primary purpose of a Front Controller is to handle all incoming requests to an application and then delegate these requests to the appropriate handlers, such as controllers or actions. This pattern is particularly useful for improving the structure and maintainability of web applications.

Key Concepts of Front Controller
- Centralized Request Handling: All requests go through a single controller, which handles common processing logic such as security, logging, and request dispatching.
- Request Delegation: The front controller delegates requests to appropriate handlers (e.g., controllers, actions) based on the request information (e.g., URL, parameters).
- Separation of Concerns: The front controller pattern helps separate system-wide concerns from specific request handling logic, making the application easier to maintain and extend.

###  DispatcherServlet in Spring MVC

The `DispatcherServlet` is a core component of the Spring Web MVC framework. It acts as the front controller in the Spring MVC architecture. The `DispatcherServlet` is responsible for handling all incoming HTTP requests and dispatching them to the appropriate handlers/controllers.

####  How `DispatcherServlet` Works

1. **Initialization**:
    - The `DispatcherServlet` is initialized during the startup of the web application.
    - It reads the Spring configuration (either XML or Java-based) to set up the application context, which includes controller mappings, view resolvers, and other necessary beans.

2. **Request Handling**:
    - When an HTTP request is received, the `DispatcherServlet` intercepts it.
    - It then performs several key steps to process the request and generate the response.

####  Detailed Workflow of `DispatcherServlet`

1. **Request Interception**:
    - All incoming requests are directed to the `DispatcherServlet` because of the servlet mapping defined in the `web.xml` or auto-configured in Spring Boot applications.

2. **Locate Handler**:
    - The `DispatcherServlet` uses a `HandlerMapping` to find the appropriate controller or handler method to handle the request.
    - It inspects the URL and other request attributes to determine which handler should process the request.

3. **Invoke Handler**:
    - Once the handler is found, the `DispatcherServlet` uses a `HandlerAdapter` to invoke the handler method.
    - The handler method typically processes the request, interacts with the model, and returns a logical view name.

4. **Process View**:
    - The `DispatcherServlet` consults a `ViewResolver` to resolve the logical view name returned by the handler into an actual view (e.g., a JSP page, a Thymeleaf template).
    - The resolved view is then rendered with the model data and produces the final HTML response.

5. **Return Response**:
    - The `DispatcherServlet` sends the generated response back to the client.

### JSP (JavaServer Pages)

#### What is JSP?

JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a server-side technology used to create dynamic, platform-independent web applications. JSP allows developers to embed Java code in HTML pages to generate content dynamically. It is a part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform.

#### Key Features of JSP

- **Separation of Concerns**: Separates the presentation layer from the business logic by embedding Java code in HTML pages.
- **Reusable Components**: Supports reusable components such as JavaBeans, custom tags, and tag libraries.
- **Simplified Page Creation**: Provides a simplified way to create dynamic web pages without the need for extensive Java coding.
- **Integration with Servlets**: Works seamlessly with servlets to handle complex request processing.

6. 
- HttpServlet: Provides methods to handle HTTP-specific requests.
- GenericServlet: Protocol-independent servlet for handling requests and responses.
- SingleThreadModel: Ensures single-threaded request handling (deprecated).
- AsyncServlet: Supports asynchronous processing of servlet requests.
