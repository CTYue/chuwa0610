## 2.  What is MVC pattern?
- The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a design pattern commonly used in software engineering to separate the concerns of a software application into three interconnected components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. This separation helps in organizing code, making it more modular, easier to maintain, and scalable.

## 3.  What is Front-Controller?
- The Front Controller is a design pattern used in web applications to centralize request handling. Instead of each request being handled by individual components, a single controller (the "front controller") handles all incoming requests and dispatches them to appropriate handlers or views. This pattern is commonly used in MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectures.

## 4.  What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.
- The DispatcherServlet is a central component in the Spring MVC framework. It acts as the front controller, responsible for managing the entire request handling process. The DispatcherServlet is essential for directing incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate handlers (controllers) and managing the flow of the web application.
- Request Mapping:
  - Routes incoming requests to the appropriate controller based on the URL and HTTP method.
  - Uses handler mappings to determine which controller method should handle the request.
- Handler Execution:
  - Invokes the appropriate controller method to process the request.
  - Handles the controller's execution and manages the flow from receiving the request to returning the response.


## 5.  What is JSP and What is ModelAndViewï¼Ÿ(please google to have a basic knowlege)
- JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology used for developing dynamic web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types. JSP is a part of Java EE (Enterprise Edition) and provides a simplified way to create web content that has both static and dynamic components.
```jsp
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" pageEncoding="UTF-8"%>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Welcome</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to JSP!</h1>
    <p>Current time: <%= new java.util.Date() %></p>
</body>
</html>
```
- ModelAndView is a class provided by Spring Framework used in Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) applications. It holds both the model data and the view name, making it a key component in handling web requests and responses.
```java
@Controller
public class ExampleController {

  @RequestMapping("/hello")
  public ModelAndView hello() {
    ModelAndView modelAndView = new ModelAndView();
    modelAndView.setViewName("hello"); // Name of the view
    modelAndView.addObject("message", "Hello, World!"); // Adding data to the model
    return modelAndView;
  }
}

```



## 6.  Could you please google any other servlets

- GenericServlet: This is a protocol-independent servlet class, which can be used for creating servlets that work with various protocols like HTTP, FTP, or SMTP. It serves as a base class for other servlets

- HttpServlet: This class extends GenericServlet and is specific to the HTTP protocol. It is commonly used in web applications to handle HTTP requests and responses.



## 7.  How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)\

- Apache HTTP Server: A widely-used open-source web server known for its flexibility and robust features.
- Nginx: Known for its high performance and low resource consumption, often used as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
- Jetty: A lightweight, highly scalable web server and servlet container often used for machine-to-machine communication.
- Apache Tomcat: An open-source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, and Java Expression Language technologies.
- Gunicorn, which stands for "Green Unicorn," is a Python WSGI HTTP server for UNIX.
