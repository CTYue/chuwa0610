## 1.  List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
See [annotations.md](annotations.md)
## 2.  What is MVC pattern?
- The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a design pattern commonly used in Java Spring Boot applications. 
- It helps to separate concerns within an application, making it easier to manage, scale, and test.
- Controller 
  - Manages an d processes user input, and updates the model and view accordingly.
  - Represents the data and the business logic of the application.
  - Handles HTTP requests and maps them to appropriate service calls and returns the response.
  - Typically Java classes annotated with @Controller or @RestController.
- Model
  - Container for Data
  - It includes the entities, services, and repositories
- View
  - Represents the user interface (UI) of the application.
  - It displays the data from the model to the user and sends user commands to the controller.
  - In Spring Boot, views are usually implemented using templates .
## 3.  What is Front-Controller?
- A centralized entry point for handling all incoming requests in a web application
- The front controller maps the incoming request to a controller
- Common request processing tasks such as authentication, logging, and request validation.
- Processes the requests and dispatches them to the appropriate handlers (controllers)
- Implemented by the DispatcherServlet
## 4.  What is DispatcherServlet? please describe how it works.
- It is a central component in the Spring MVC framework, responsible for handling all incoming HTTP requests and dispatching them to the appropriate controllers for processing
- Mapping an HTTP request to a certain processing method
- Parsing of HTTP request data and headers into data transfer objects (DTOs)or domain objects
- Model-view-controller interaction
- Generation of responses from DTOs, domain objects, etc.
## 5.  What is JSP and What is ModelAndView？(please google to have a basic knowledge)
### JSP (JavaServer Pages)
- A technology used for creating dynamically generated web pages
- Designed to simplify the creation of web-based user interfaces for Java applications.
- Allows the separation of the presentation layer from the business logic.
### ModelAndView
- Both the model and the view in a single object. 
- It represents both the data that will be displayed in the view and the view itself.
- It is used by controllers to return data (model) and the name of the view that should render the data.
## 6.  Could you please google any other servlets(理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间，知道servlet的名字就行。)
### HttpServlet: 
- The most widely used servlet, HttpServlet is designed for handling HTTP requests and responses. It provides methods like doGet(), doPost(), doPut(), and doDelete(), making it versatile for various types of web interactions.
### GenericServlet: 
- This is a protocol-independent servlet, which can be used as a base class for creating servlets that handle other types of requests besides HTTP. It requires the service() method to be overridden to handle requests.
### RequestDispatcher: 
- This servlet is used to forward a request from one servlet to another or to include the content of another resource (such as HTML or JSP) in the response. This allows for better modularization and reuse of web components.
## 7.  How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)
### Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services): 
- A flexible, secure, and manageable Web server for hosting anything on the Web, including websites, services, and applications. It is closely integrated with the Windows operating system, making it a common choice for enterprise environments.

### NGINX: 
- A high-performance web server and reverse proxy server known for its ability to handle a large number of concurrent connections. It is often used for load balancing, HTTP caching, and as a reverse proxy.

### Flask: 
- Unlike the other web servers listed, Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. It is designed for simplicity and flexibility, making it suitable for small to medium-sized applications. Flask is often used in microservices and smaller web applications due to its simplicity and ease of use​
## 8.  clone this repo, and run it in you local.
- 1.  https://github.com/CTYue/springmvc5-demo
- 2.  Notice that you need to configure the Tomcat by yourself. tutorial in the slides.
- 3.  find out the APIs in controller and call some APIs, In slides, I also list some API.
- 4.  remember to create a database for this project
- 5.  all details in the slides.
