## SpringBoot

2.

The annotations in the given code snippet are used to define how the fields in a Java class map to columns in a database table. Below is an explanation of each annotation:

### Code Snippet
```java
@Column(columnDefinition = "varchar(255) default 'John Snow'")
private String name;

@Column(name="STUDENT_NAME", length=50, nullable=false, unique=false)
private String studentName;
```

### Explanation

1. **`@Column(columnDefinition = "varchar(255) default 'John Snow'")`**
    - This annotation is applied to the `name` field.
    - **`columnDefinition = "varchar(255) default 'John Snow'"`**:
        - Specifies the SQL fragment that is used when generating the DDL for the column.
        - In this case, it defines the column as a `varchar` type with a maximum length of 255 characters.
        - The default value for this column is set to `'John Snow'`.

2. **`@Column(name="STUDENT_NAME", length=50, nullable=false, unique=false)`**
    - This annotation is applied to the `studentName` field.
    - **`name="STUDENT_NAME"`**:
        - Specifies the name of the column in the database.
        - Here, the column will be named `STUDENT_NAME`.
    - **`length=50`**:
        - Defines the maximum length of the column.
        - This column can store up to 50 characters.
    - **`nullable=false`**:
        - Indicates that the column cannot be `null`.
        - This means the column is required and must have a value.
    - **`unique=false`**:
        - Indicates that the column does not need to have unique values.
        - This means that the same value can appear multiple times in this column.

3.

The annotations in the given code snippet do not specify custom column names. Therefore, the default column names are derived from the field names in the Java class. Below is an explanation of how the default column names are determined:

### Code Snippet
```java
@Column
private String firstName;

@Column
private String operatingSystem;
```

### Explanation

1. **`@Column` annotation on `firstName` field**:
    - The annotation does not specify a custom column name.
    - By default, the column name will be the same as the field name, which is `firstName`.

2. **`@Column` annotation on `operatingSystem` field**:
    - The annotation does not specify a custom column name.
    - By default, the column name will be the same as the field name, which is `operatingSystem`.

### Summary
- The default column names in the database for the given fields are:
    - `firstName` for the `firstName` field.
    - `operatingSystem` for the `operatingSystem` field.

4. 
- Presentation Layer

   The presentation layer, also known as the web layer, is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses.
   It includes the controllers and views in the application.
   This layer interacts directly with the client/browser.
- Service Layer
   The service layer contains business logic.
   It acts as an intermediary between the presentation layer and the repository layer.
   This layer ensures the application's business rules are followed. 
- Repository Layer
The repository layer handles data access and persistence.
It interacts with the database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
This layer abstracts the data access details from the service layer.
- Domain Layer
   The domain layer contains the core business entities and logic.
   It represents the data and behavior of the business domain.
   This layer is also known as the model layer.
-  Configuration Layer
   The configuration layer manages application configuration and setup.
   It includes settings for security, database connections, and other framework configurations.
5. 
- Postman sends an HTTP request.
- Controller receives the request, maps it to a method, and calls the service layer.
- Service Layer processes the request and calls the repository layer if needed.
- Repository Layer interacts with the database and returns data to the service layer.
- Service Layer processes the data and returns it to the controller.
- Controller formats the response and sends it back to Postman.
- Postman receives the HTTP response with the requested data.

6. 
The application.properties file is a configuration file used in Spring Boot applications. It is used to define configuration settings, such as database connection details, server port, logging levels, and more. The properties defined in this file are key-value pairs.

The application.yml file is another format for configuring Spring Boot applications. YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a more human-readable format compared to .properties. It allows hierarchical data structures, which makes it easier to manage complex configurations.
