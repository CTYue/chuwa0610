# Chuwa Homework 14 MingHao(Howard) Lee 
## 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
`@Aspect` annotation can be used to implement an aspect.
Aspects are mostly used to enable cross-cutting concerns like logging, profiling, caching, and transaction management.

`@Configuration`
- Indicates a class is a source of bean definitions for the Spring IoC container.
- Used to define beans and configuration settings within a Java class.
- Often paired with `@Bean` annotated methods.

`@EnableAspectJAutoProxy`
- Enables support for handling components marked with AspectJ's `@Aspect` annotation.
- Tells Spring to automatically create proxies for beans annotated with Spring AOP annotations.
- Facilitates weaving of cross-cutting concerns like logging and transaction management.

### Creating Aspects with `@Aspect`

1. Define an Aspect:
   - Use the `@Aspect` annotation to mark a class as an aspect.
   - This class will contain methods that define cross-cutting concerns, such as logging or transaction management.

2. Register with Spring:
   - Use the `@Component` annotation to register the aspect class as a bean in the Spring container.
   - This allows Spring to manage the aspect and apply it to the appropriate join points (places in the code where the aspect should be applied).

### Key Steps:

- Annotate the class with `@Aspect` to define it as an aspect.
- Annotate the same class with `@Component` to ensure it is picked up by Spring's component scanning and managed as a Spring bean.

### Example Outline:

- Define an aspect class.
- Use advice annotations within the aspect class, such as `@Before`, `@After`, `@Around`, to specify when the cross-cutting concern should be executed in relation to the join point.

## 2. Briefly reading: [Spring AOP Interview Questions](https://www.techgeeknext.com/spring-boot/spring-aop-interview-questions)

## 3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming, explain it with detailed use cases?
Aspect about AOP is a **cross-cutting module that combines advice and pointcuts**.
A standard class tagged with the `@Aspect` annotation can be used to implement an aspect.

Aspects are mostly used to enable cross-cutting concerns like logging, profiling, caching, and transaction management.


## 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
### Advantages of Spring AOP
1. It is easy to configure.
2. Spring AOP is implemented in pure Java, so separate compilation unit or separate class loader are not required.
3. It utilizes Spring's IOC container for dependency injection.
4. Can create aspects using `@AspectJ` annotation based or using XML based.
5. It integrates cross-cutting concerns into the classes.

### Disadvantages of Spring AOP
1. Debugging the AOP framework-based application code is a little challenge.
2. Only methods with a public visibility will be recommended, not those with a private, protected, or default visibility.
3. Aspects cannot be advised by other aspects. This is because once a class is marked as an aspect (using XML or annotation), Spring prevents it from being auto-proxied.


## 5. Explain following concept in your own words, you may include code snippet as part of your answer.
### 1. Aspect 
#### Definition:
- An aspect is a module that encapsulates a concern that cuts across multiple classes or modules. It contains the code for cross-cutting concerns like logging, transaction management, or security.
```java
@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Logging before method: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
    }
}
```
### 2. PointCut 
#### Defination: 
- A pointcut defines a set of join points where an advice should be executed. It is a preficate that matches join points
  and determines whethe the advice should be applied.
```Java
@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Pointcut("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void serviceMethods() {
        // Pointcut expression matching all methods in the service package
    }

    @Before("serviceMethods()")
    public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Logging before method: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
    }
}
```
### 3. JoinPoint 
#### Defination: 
- A join points is a pecific point in the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handing of an exception.
  Join points are the points where an aspect can be applied.

```Java
  @Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Logging before method: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
        // Additional information about the join point can be accessed here
    }
}
```
  
### 4. Advice
#### Defination: 
- Advice is the action taken by an aspect at a particular join point.
  Different types of advice include `@Before`, `@After`, `@Around`, `@AfterReturning`, and `@AfterThrowing`.
```Java
@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Logging before method: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
    }

    @After("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void logAfter(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Logging after method: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
    }

    @Around("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public Object logAround(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("Logging around method: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
        Object result = joinPoint.proceed();
        System.out.println("Logging around after method: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
        return result;
    }
}
```
#### Summary:

- **Aspect**: Module encapsulating a cross-cutting concern.
- **PointCut**: Predicate that matches join points to apply advice.
- **JoinPoint**: Specific point in the execution of a program where advice can be applied.
- **Advice**: Action taken by an aspect at a particular join point, such as logging or security checks.

## 6. How do we declare a pointcut, can we declare it without annotating an empty method? Name some expressions to do it.
### Key Points:

- **Pointcut Declaration**: A pointcut can be declared using the `@Pointcut` annotation.
- **Empty Method**: Common practice is to annotate an empty method with `@Pointcut` to name and reuse the pointcut.
- **Direct Use**: Alternatively, pointcut expressions can be directly included in advice annotations without a separate method.

## Examples of Pointcut Expressions:

1. **Execution**:
   - Matches method execution.
   - `execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))`

2. **Within**:
   - Matches join points within certain types.
   - `within(com.example.service..*)`

3. **This**:
   - Matches join points where the bean reference is an instance of the given type.
   - `this(com.example.service.ServiceInterface)`

4. **Target**:
   - Matches join points where the target object is an instance of the given type.
   - `target(com.example.service.ServiceInterface)`

5. **Args**:
   - Matches join points where the arguments are instances of the given types.
   - `args(java.lang.String, ..)`

## Example of Direct Use:

```java
@Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
    System.out.println("Logging before method: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
}

```


## 7. Compare different types of advices in Spring AOP.
### Types of Advices in Spring AOP

1. **Before Advice**:
   - Executes before the join point method.
   - Syntax: `@Before("pointcutExpression")`
   - Use case: Logging, security checks.

2. **After (Finally) Advice**:
   - Executes after the join point method completes, regardless of its outcome.
   - Syntax: `@After("pointcutExpression")`
   - Use case: Resource cleanup, logging.

3. **After Returning Advice**:
   - Executes after the join point method successfully completes.
   - Syntax: `@AfterReturning(pointcut="pointcutExpression", returning="returnValue")`
   - Use case: Post-processing of returned data.

4. **After Throwing Advice**:
   - Executes if the join point method exits by throwing an exception.
   - Syntax: `@AfterThrowing(pointcut="pointcutExpression", throwing="exception")`
   - Use case: Error handling, logging exceptions.

5. **Around Advice**:
   - Surrounds the join point method, allows to control method execution.
   - Syntax: `@Around("pointcutExpression")`
   - Use case: Performance monitoring, transaction management, modifying method execution.

## 11. How does Spring Batch work? you may include code snippet as part of your answer.
1. **Job**:
   - Represents a batch job containing multiple steps.
   - Defined using the `Job` interface.

2. **Step**:
   - A single unit of work within a job.
   - Includes a `Tasklet` or `ItemReader`, `ItemProcessor`, and `ItemWriter`.

3. **JobLauncher**:
   - Launches the job with specific parameters.
   - Defined using the `JobLauncher` interface.

4. **JobRepository**:
   - Stores the status and metadata of batch jobs.
   - Ensures job execution information is persisted.

5. **JobConfiguration**:
   - Configures the job and steps.
   - Uses annotations like `@Configuration`, `@EnableBatchProcessing`, `@Bean`.

### Code Example
```Java
@Configuration
@EnableBatchProcessing
public class BatchConfig {

    @Autowired
    private JobBuilderFactory jobBuilderFactory;

    @Autowired
    private StepBuilderFactory stepBuilderFactory;

    @Bean
    public Job exampleJob() {
        return jobBuilderFactory.get("exampleJob")
                .start(exampleStep())
                .build();
    }

    @Bean
    public Step exampleStep() {
        return stepBuilderFactory.get("exampleStep")
                .<String, String>chunk(10)
                .reader(itemReader())
                .processor(itemProcessor())
                .writer(itemWriter())
                .build();
    }

    @Bean
    public ItemReader<String> itemReader() {
        return new FlatFileItemReaderBuilder<String>()
                .name("itemReader")
                .resource(new ClassPathResource("input.csv"))
                .delimited()
                .names("data")
                .targetType(String.class)
                .build();
    }

    @Bean
    public ItemProcessor<String, String> itemProcessor() {
        return item -> item.toUpperCase();
    }

    @Bean
    public ItemWriter<String> itemWriter() {
        return items -> items.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```
### Summary:
- **Job**: Defines the batch job.
- **Step**: A unit of work within a job.
- **JobLauncher**: Launches jobs.
- **JobRepository**: Stores job metadata.
- **Configuration**: Uses annotations to set up jobs and steps.

## 12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
### Key Points:

1. **Use Spring's `@EnableScheduling`**:
   - Enables scheduling support in the Spring application.

2. **Define a `JobLauncher`**:
   - Launches the batch job programmatically.

3. **Create a `Scheduler` method**:
   - Annotate with `@Scheduled` to specify the schedule.
  
### Code Example
```Java
@Configuration
@EnableBatchProcessing
@EnableScheduling
public class BatchSchedulerConfig {

    @Autowired
    private JobLauncher jobLauncher;

    @Autowired
    private Job job;

    @Bean
    public Job exampleJob(JobBuilderFactory jobBuilderFactory, StepBuilderFactory stepBuilderFactory) {
        return jobBuilderFactory.get("exampleJob")
                .start(exampleStep(stepBuilderFactory))
                .build();
    }

    @Bean
    public Step exampleStep(StepBuilderFactory stepBuilderFactory) {
        return stepBuilderFactory.get("exampleStep")
                .<String, String>chunk(10)
                .reader(itemReader())
                .processor(itemProcessor())
                .writer(itemWriter())
                .build();
    }

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 * * * ?") // Runs every hour
    public void performJob() throws Exception {
        JobParameters jobParameters = new JobParametersBuilder()
                .addLong("time", System.currentTimeMillis())
                .toJobParameters();
        jobLauncher.run(job, jobParameters);
    }

    // Define itemReader, itemProcessor, and itemWriter beans as needed
}
```
### Summary:
- **Enable Scheduling**: Use `@EnableScheduling` annotation.
- **JobLauncher**: Define a `JobLauncher` bean to launch the job.
- **Scheduled Method**: Use `@Scheduled` annotation to set the job's schedule.
- **Cron Expression**: Customize the `cron` expression to specify the job frequency.

## 13. What is the cron expression?
#### Key Points:
- **Definition**: A cron expression is a string comprising five or six fields representing a schedule.
- **Purpose**: Specifies the exact time intervals for executing scheduled tasks.

#### Fields in a Cron Expression:
1. **Seconds** (0-59)
2. **Minutes** (0-59)
3. **Hours** (0-23)
4. **Day of Month** (1-31)
5. **Month** (1-12 or JAN-DEC)
6. **Day of Week** (0-7 or SUN-SAT, where 0 and 7 represent Sunday)

#### Special Characters:
- **Asterisk (*)**: Every unit (e.g., every minute)
- **Comma (,)**: List of values (e.g., 1,2,3)
- **Dash (-)**: Range of values (e.g., 1-5)
- **Slash (/)**: Step values (e.g., */5 means every 5 units)
- **Question Mark (?)**: No specific value (only in Day of Month and Day of Week)

#### Examples:
- `0 0 * * * *` : Every hour
- `0 0 12 * * ?` : Every day at noon
- `0 15 10 * * ?` : Every day at 10:15 AM
- `0 0 12 1 * ?` : At noon on the first day of every month
- `0 0 0 ? * MON` : Every Monday at midnight

#### Usage:
- **Scheduling**: Defines precise schedules for tasks like batch jobs, backups, and reports.
- **Flexibility**: Allows complex and specific scheduling patterns.


## 14. Explain Spring task?
#### Key Points:
- **Purpose**: Provides support for scheduling and asynchronous execution of tasks in a Spring application.
- **Components**: Includes annotations and configuration options for defining and managing scheduled and asynchronous tasks.

#### Main Annotations and Components:

1. `@EnableScheduling`:
    - Enables Spring's scheduled task execution capability.

2. `@Scheduled`:
    - Schedules a method to run at fixed intervals or specific times using cron expressions or fixed delays/rates.
    - **Attributes**:
        - `cron`: Specifies a cron expression for scheduling.
        - `fixedRate`: Runs the method at a fixed interval (in milliseconds) from the start of the last invocation.
        - `fixedDelay`: Runs the method at a fixed interval (in milliseconds) after the completion of the last invocation.
        - `initialDelay`: Specifies the initial delay before the first execution (in milliseconds).

3. `@Async`:
    - Marks a method for asynchronous execution.
    - Requires `@EnableAsync` to be configured.

#### Example: Scheduling a Task
```Java
@Configuration
@EnableScheduling
public class TaskSchedulerConfig {

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 * * * ?") // Runs every hour
    public void scheduledTask() {
        System.out.println("Scheduled task executed at: " + LocalDateTime.now());
    }
}
```
#### Example: Asynchronous Task
```Java
@Configuration
@EnableAsync
public class AsyncConfig {
}

@Service
public class AsyncService {

    @Async
    public void asyncMethod() {
        System.out.println("Async method executed in thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
```
#### Usage Scenarios:
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Automating periodic tasks like data cleanup, backups, and report generation.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Running tasks in the background without blocking the main thread, such as handling long-running computations or I/O operations.

Spring Task simplifies the management and execution of scheduled and asynchronous tasks, improving application performance and responsiveness.



## 15. What is Filter and any filter example?
#### Key Points:

- **Purpose**: Filters are used to perform filtering tasks such as logging, authentication, authorization, and input validation before and after a request is processed by a servlet.
- **Location**: Typically applied to HTTP requests and responses.
- **Implementation**: Implemented using the `javax.servlet.Filter` interface.

#### Filter Interface Methods:

1. `init(FilterConfig filterConfig)`:
   - Initializes the filter.

2. `doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)`:
   - Processes the request and response, and optionally passes them to the next filter in the chain.

3. `destroy()`:
   - Cleanup code when the filter is taken out of service.

#### Example: Logging Filter
- 1. Filter Implementation:
```Java
import javax.servlet.Filter;
import javax.servlet.FilterChain;
import javax.servlet.FilterConfig;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.ServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.ServletResponse;
import java.io.IOException;

public class LoggingFilter implements Filter {

    @Override
    public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {
        // Initialization code, if needed
    }

    @Override
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        System.out.println("Request received at " + new Date());
        
        // Pass the request along the filter chain
        chain.doFilter(request, response);
        
        System.out.println("Response sent at " + new Date());
    }

    @Override
    public void destroy() {
        // Cleanup code, if needed
    }
}
```
- 2. Registering the Filter in Spring Boot:
```Java
import org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.FilterRegistrationBean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class FilterConfig {

    @Bean
    public FilterRegistrationBean<LoggingFilter> loggingFilter() {
        FilterRegistrationBean<LoggingFilter> registrationBean = new FilterRegistrationBean<>();
        
        registrationBean.setFilter(new LoggingFilter());
        registrationBean.addUrlPatterns("/api/*"); // URL patterns to apply the filter
        
        return registrationBean;
    }
}
```
#### Usage Scenarios:

- **Logging**: Capturing request and response details for auditing.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Verifying user credentials and permissions.
- **Input Validation**: Checking and sanitizing user inputs.
- **Compression**: Compressing responses to reduce payload size.

Filters provide a powerful mechanism to manipulate requests and responses in a web application, ensuring cross-cutting concerns like security and logging are handled efficiently.

## 16. What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
### Key Points:

- **Purpose**: Interceptors are used to intercept HTTP requests and responses, allowing for pre-processing and post-processing of controller methods.
- **Location**: Applied to HTTP requests within the context of a Spring MVC application.
- **Implementation**: Implemented using the `HandlerInterceptor` interface.

### HandlerInterceptor Interface Methods:

1. **`preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler)`**:
   - Executed before the actual handler (controller method) is called.
   - Can be used to perform tasks like logging, authentication checks, or input validation.
   - Return `true` to continue processing, `false` to abort the execution chain.

2. **`postHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, ModelAndView modelAndView)`**:
   - Executed after the handler method, but before the view is rendered.
   - Can be used to add additional attributes to the model or modify the `ModelAndView`.

3. **`afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, Exception ex)`**:
   - Executed after the complete request has finished.
   - Can be used for resource cleanup or logging.

### Example: Logging Filter
- 1. Interceptor Implementation:
```Java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.HandlerInterceptor;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

@Component
public class LoggingInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {

    @Override
    public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) {
        System.out.println("Before handling the request: " + request.getRequestURI());
        return true; // Continue processing the request
    }

    @Override
    public void postHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, ModelAndView modelAndView) {
        System.out.println("After handling the request but before view rendering.");
    }

    @Override
    public void afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, Exception ex) {
        System.out.println("After completing the request and rendering the view.");
    }
}
```
- 2. Registering the Interceptor:
```Java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.InterceptorRegistry;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.WebMvcConfigurer;

@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Autowired
    private LoggingInterceptor loggingInterceptor;

    @Override
    public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
        registry.addInterceptor(loggingInterceptor).addPathPatterns("/api/**");
    }
}
```
### Usage Scenarios:

- **Logging**: Track incoming requests and outgoing responses.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Verify user credentials and roles before processing the request.
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize input data before it reaches the controller.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Measure the time taken to process requests.
- **Resource Management**: Manage resources like database connections or sessions.

Interceptors provide a flexible way to apply common processing logic to incoming requests and outgoing responses, making them useful for handling cross-cutting concerns in Spring MVC applications.


## 17. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
#### preHandle:

- **Purpose**: Executes before the actual handler (controller method) is invoked.
- **Usage**:
  - **Authentication**: Check if the user is authenticated before proceeding.
  - **Logging**: Log request details.
  - **Validation**: Validate request parameters or headers.
  - **Authorization**: Ensure the user has the necessary permissions.
- **Return Value**:
  - `true`: Continue processing the request.
  - `false`: Abort the request processing.

#### Code Snippet:
```Java
@Override
public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) {
    System.out.println("Before handling the request: " + request.getRequestURI());
    return true; // Continue processing the request
}
```
#### postHandle:

- **Purpose**: Executes after the handler (controller method) is called but before the view is rendered.
- **Usage**:
  - **Modify Model**: Add or modify attributes in the `ModelAndView`.
  - **Logging**: Log details of the response.
  - **Performance Monitoring**: Measure the time taken by the handler method.
- **Parameters**:
  - `HttpServletRequest request`
  - `HttpServletResponse response`
  - `Object handler` (the handler or controller that was executed)
  - `ModelAndView modelAndView` (the model and view that will be rendered)

#### Code Snippet:
```Java
@Override
public void postHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, ModelAndView modelAndView) {
    System.out.println("After handling the request but before view rendering.");
}
```

#### Summary:

- **preHandle**:
  - Executes before the controller method.
  - Used for pre-processing logic like authentication, logging, validation.
  - Controls whether the request should proceed or be aborted.

- **postHandle**:
  - Executes after the controller method but before view rendering.
  - Used for post-processing logic like modifying the model, logging, and performance monitoring.

## 18. What is Swagger, why do we need it? What does it do except "documentation"?
### Key Points:

- **Definition**: Swagger is a framework for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful web services.
- **Need**: Facilitates the development, testing, and integration of APIs by providing clear, standardized documentation and tools.

### Why Do We Need Swagger?

- **Standardization**: Ensures APIs follow a consistent format, making them easier to understand and use.
- **Ease of Use**: Provides interactive API documentation that allows developers to test endpoints directly from the documentation.
- **Collaboration**: Enhances communication and collaboration between front-end and back-end developers by providing a clear API contract.
- **Automation**: Helps automate the generation of API documentation, reducing manual effort and errors.
- **Client Code Generation**: Generates client libraries in various programming languages to interact with the API.

### What Does Swagger Do Besides Documentation?

1. **Interactive API Explorer**:
   - Provides an interactive UI (Swagger UI) to test API endpoints.
   - Allows developers to send requests and see responses directly from the browser.

2. **API Specification**:
   - Uses OpenAPI Specification (OAS) to describe the API, which can be used to generate documentation, client libraries, and server stubs.

3. **Client and Server Code Generation**:
   - Generates client SDKs in multiple languages (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript) to consume the API.
   - Generates server stubs in various languages to help implement the API quickly.

4. **Validation**:
   - Ensures that the API implementation matches the API specification.
   - Helps in maintaining consistency and reliability of the API.

5. **Mock Server**:
   - Provides mock implementations of the API to test client applications before the actual implementation is ready.

6. **API Versioning**:
   - Facilitates managing multiple versions of an API, ensuring backward compatibility and smooth transitions between versions.

### Summary:

- **Swagger**: A comprehensive framework for API design, documentation, and consumption.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Standardization and Clarity**: Ensures consistent API design.
  - **Interactive Testing**: Provides tools for testing APIs interactively.
  - **Automation and Efficiency**: Automates documentation and code generation.
  - **Validation and Consistency**: Validates API implementations against the specification.
  - **Mocking and Testing**: Supports API mocking for early testing of client applications.

Swagger enhances the API development lifecycle by providing tools and standards that improve communication, testing, and integration, making API development more efficient and reliable.
