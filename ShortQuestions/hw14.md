## 3.  What is the Aspect Oriented Programming, explain it with detailed use cases?

## 4.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
* pros: non-invasive
* cons: difficult to debug, nly method level advising is supported

## 5.  Explain following concept in your own words, you may include code snippet as part of your answer.
1.  Aspect: An Aspect is a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes.
2.  PointCut: where to execute
3.  JoinPoint: a point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception.
4.  Advice:  action taken by an aspect at a particular join point

## 6.  How do we declare a pointcut, can we declare it without annotating an empty method? Name some expressions to do it.
``` java
@Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
    System.out.println("Executing: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
}

// or

@Aspect
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Pointcut("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void serviceMethods() {
        // This method is empty because it's only used as a holder for the pointcut expression
    }

    @Before("serviceMethods()")
    public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Executing: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
    }

    @AfterReturning(pointcut = "serviceMethods()", returning = "result")
    public void logAfterReturning(JoinPoint joinPoint, Object result) {
        System.out.println("Method executed successfully: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
        System.out.println("Returned: " + result);
    }

```
## 7.  Compare different types of advices in Spring AOP.
* Before: Runs before the join point (method execution).
* After: Runs after the join point
* After Returning: Runs after the join point only if it completes normally
* After Throwing: Runs after the join point only if it throws an exception.
* Around: Runs before and after the join point.

## 9.  Spring WebFlux vs Stream API+CompletableFuture, why use Spring WebFlux over the other?
* Asynchronous and Non-blocking, Integration with Spring Ecosystem, Better Resource Utilization

## 10.  When to use Spring Batch? please provide detailed exaples with business context.
* Periodic application of complex business rules processed repetitively across very large data sets (for example, insurance benefit determination or rate adjustments).

## 11.  How does Spring Batch work? you may include code snippet as part of your answer.
* *ob Configuration: Define the job and steps.
* Step Configuration: Define the steps, including readers, processors, and writers.
* Job Execution: Launch the job using JobLauncher.

## 12.  How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
``` java
@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 0 * * ?")
```

## 13.  What is the cron expression?
* A cron expression is a string consisting of six or seven fields separated by white space that represents a set of times

## 14.  Explain Spring task? 
* Spring Task is a feature of the Spring Framework that allows for scheduling tasks in a Spring application. It provides a robust and flexible way to schedule tasks using various scheduling mechanisms, such as fixed rate, fixed delay, and cron expressions. Spring Task also integrates well with other Spring components, making it a powerful tool for background task execution and scheduling.

## 15.  What is Filter and any filter example?
* a filter is a component that performs filtering tasks on either the request to a resource (such as a servlet or a static file) or on the response from a resource, or both.

## 16.  What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
* an interceptor is a component that allows you to intercept HTTP requests and responses at various stages of their processing.
* Interceptors in Spring MVC offer a powerful mechanism for handling cross-cutting concerns and manipulating requests and responses in a flexible and reusable manner.

## 17.  In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
* preHandle: Called before the handler (controller) is executed.
* postHandle: Called after the handler is executed, but before the view is rendered.

## 18.  What is Swagger, why do we need it? What does it do except "documentation"?
* Swagger is a set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services. It provides a standard way to describe APIs and facilitates communication between developers and stakeholders.
* Interactive API Explorer, API Design and Prototyping, Code Generation, API Testing, API Lifecycle Management
