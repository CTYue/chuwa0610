3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of SpringAOP?

   **Advantages**

   1. **Modularity**:
      - AOP promotes modularization by separating cross-cutting concerns from the core business logic. This makes the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.
   2. **Reusability**:
      - Aspects can be reused across multiple classes and methods, reducing code duplication and improving consistency.
   3. **Maintenance**:
      - Changes to cross-cutting concerns, such as logging or security, can be made in a single place, rather than scattered throughout the codebase.
   4. **Decoupling**:
      - AOP decouples the aspect logic from the business logic, making it easier to understand and modify each independently.

   **Disadvantages**

   1. **A Little Performance Overhead (negligible)**:
      - There may be a performance overhead associated with using AOP due to the additional processing required to apply aspects.
   2. **Only methods with public visibility will be advised**
      - Methods with protected, private or default visibility will not be advised.
   3. **Aspects cannot advise other Aspects** 
      - Not possible to have aspects to be the target of advice from other aspects. Because once you mark one class as an aspect (either using XML or annotation), spring excludes it from being auto-proxied.
   4. **A little difficult to debug the AOP based application code.**
      - Since the business classes are advised behind the scene with aspects.

5. Explain following concept in your own words, you may include code snippet as part of your answer.

   1. **Aspect**: A module that encapsulates a cross-cutting concern. An aspect can include advice (code to be executed), pointcuts (locations where the advice should be applied), and introductions (methods or fields added to existing classes).
   2. **PointCut**: A set of one or more join points where an advice should be applied. Pointcuts are defined using expressions.
   3. **Join Point**: A point in the execution of the program, such as a method call or field assignment, where an aspect can be applied.
   4. **Advice**: The code that is executed when a join point is reached. There are different types of advice:
      - **Before**: Executes before the join point.
      - **After**: Executes after the join point, regardless of the outcome.
      - **After Returning**: Executes after the join point if it completes successfully.
      - **After Throwing**: Executes if the join point throws an exception.
      - **Around**: Surrounds the join point, allowing to control when and whether the join point is executed.

6. How do we declare a pointcut, can we declare it without annotating an empty method? Name some expressions to do it.

   **Declaring Pointcut with annotations**:

   ```java
   import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;
   
   @Aspect
   public class MyAspect {
       
       @Pointcut("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
       private void anyMethodInService() {
           // This method is empty and serves as a placeholder for the pointcut expression.
       }
       
       @Before("anyMethodInService()")
       public void beforeAdvice() {
           System.out.println("A method in the service package is about to be executed.");
       }
   }
   ```

   **Common Pointcut expressions**

   Here are some common pointcut expressions used in Spring AOP:

   1. **`execution`**:
      - Matches method execution join points.
      - Example: `execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))` matches any method in any class within the `com.example.service` package.
   2. **`within`**:
      - Limits matching to join points within certain types.
      - Example: `within(com.example.service..*)` matches any join point within any class in the `com.example.service` package and its sub-packages.
   3. **`this`**:
      - Limits matching to join points where the bean reference is an instance of the given type.
      - Example: `this(com.example.service.MyService)` matches join points where the bean reference is an instance of `MyService`.
   4. **`target`**:
      - Limits matching to join points where the target object is an instance of the given type.
      - Example: `target(com.example.service.MyService)` matches join points where the target object is an instance of `MyService`.
   5. **`args`**:
      - Limits matching to join points where the arguments are instances of the given types.
      - Example: `args(java.lang.String, int)` matches join points where the method arguments are a `String` and an `int`.
   6. **`@annotation`**:
      - Limits matching to join points where the subject of the join point has the given annotation.
      - Example: `@annotation(org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional)` matches join points where the method is annotated with `@Transactional`.

7. Compare different types of advices in Spring AOP.

   1. **Before Advice**

   - Before advice runs before the method execution. It doesn't have the ability to prevent the method from being called unless it throws an exception.

     ```java
     import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
     import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;
     
     @Aspect
     public class MyAspect {
         
         @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
         public void beforeAdvice() {
             System.out.println("Before method execution");
         }
     }
     ```

   2. **After Returning Advice**

   - After returning advice runs after the method execution only if the method completes **successfully**. It can access the returned value and modify it if necessary.

     ```java
     import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.AfterReturning;
     import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
     
     @Aspect
     public class MyAspect {
         
         @AfterReturning(pointcut = "execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))", returning = "result")
         public void afterReturningAdvice(Object result) {
             System.out.println("After method returned with value: " + result);
         }
     }
     ```

   3. **After Throwing Advice**

   - After throwing advice runs after the method execution only if the method exits by throwing an exception. It can be used to handle exceptions.

     ```java
     import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.AfterThrowing;
     import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
     
     @Aspect
     public class MyAspect {
         
         @AfterThrowing(pointcut = "execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))", throwing = "error")
         public void afterThrowingAdvice(Throwable error) {
             System.out.println("After method threw an exception: " + error);
         }
     }
     ```

   4. **After (Finally) Advice**

   - After (finally) advice runs after the method execution, regardless of its outcome (whether it completed successfully or threw an exception).

     ```java
     import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.After;
     import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
     
     @Aspect
     public class MyAspect {
         
         @After("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
         public void afterAdvice() {
             System.out.println("After method execution (finally)");
         }
     }
     ```

   5. **Around Advice**

   - Around advice surrounds the method execution. It has the most control because it can decide whether to proceed with the method execution or return a different value. It can also modify the arguments before method execution and modify the result after method execution.

     ```java
     import org.aspectj.lang.ProceedingJoinPoint;
     import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Around;
     import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
     
     @Aspect
     public class MyAspect {
         
         @Around("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
         public Object aroundAdvice(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
             System.out.println("Before method execution");
             Object result = joinPoint.proceed();
             System.out.println("After method execution");
             return result;
         }
     }
     ```

9. Spring WebFlux vs StreamAPI + CompletableFuture, **why use Spring WebFlux over the other?**

   **End-to-End Reactive Framework:**

   - Spring WebFlux provides a complete end-to-end reactive framework, from the client to the server, designed for building reactive applications. The Stream API and CompletableFuture, while powerful, do not provide this level of integration and support for reactive streams.

   **Backpressure Support:**

   - WebFlux inherently supports backpressure, essential for building robust reactive systems. The Stream API and CompletableFuture lack built-in backpressure handling, which can lead to issues under heavy load.

   **Declarative and Composable:**

   - WebFlux's reactive programming model using `Mono` and `Flux` is more declarative and composable compared to the imperative style often seen with CompletableFuture, making it easier to reason about asynchronous flows.

   **Scalability and Resource Efficiency:**

   - WebFlux's non-blocking I/O and event-loop model are designed for high scalability and efficient use of resources, making it more suitable for high-concurrency environments compared to the traditional thread-per-request model.

   **Spring Ecosystem Integration:**

   - WebFlux benefits from tight integration with the Spring ecosystem, offering features like reactive data access with Spring Data, reactive security with Spring Security, and more. This integration simplifies the development of complex, feature-rich applications.

   **Standardization and Best Practices:**

   - Using WebFlux aligns with modern best practices in building reactive systems, leveraging well-established patterns and a robust framework supported by the Spring community.

10. When to use Spring Batch? please provide detailed exaples with business context.

    Spring Batch is a robust batch processing framework built on top of the Spring Framework, designed for processing large volumes of data efficiently and reliably. It is typically used for automating repetitive tasks, processing large datasets, integrating with other systems, and ensuring the reliability and consistency of batch jobs.

    ---

    **Example 1: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Process**

    **Business Context:** A retail company needs to process daily sales data from various stores. This data, stored in different formats (CSV, XML, JSON), must be consolidated into a central database for analysis and reporting.

    **Implementation with Spring Batch:**

    - **Extract:** Spring Batch reads data from multiple sources using different `ItemReader` implementations (e.g., `FlatFileItemReader` for CSV, `StaxEventItemReader` for XML).

    - **Transform:** The data is transformed using custom `ItemProcessor` implementations. For example, converting date formats, calculating totals, or applying business rules.

    - **Load:** The transformed data is written to a central database using `JdbcBatchItemWriter` or `JpaItemWriter`

      ```java
      @Bean
      public Job etlJob(JobBuilderFactory jobBuilderFactory, StepBuilderFactory stepBuilderFactory, ItemReader<Data> reader, ItemProcessor<Data, ProcessedData> processor, ItemWriter<ProcessedData> writer) {
          Step step = stepBuilderFactory.get("etl-step")
              .<Data, ProcessedData>chunk(100)
              .reader(reader)
              .processor(processor)
              .writer(writer)
              .build();
      
          return jobBuilderFactory.get("etl-job")
              .start(step)
              .build();
      }
      ```

      ---

    **Example 2: Data Migration**

    **Business Context:** A bank is migrating its customer data from a legacy system to a new system. The migration needs to be done in a controlled manner, ensuring data integrity and allowing rollback in case of errors.

    **Implementation with Spring Batch:**

    - **Reading from Legacy System:** Use a custom `ItemReader` to read data from the legacy system.

    - **Processing:** Apply necessary transformations, such as mapping legacy data fields to new system fields.

    - **Writing to New System:** Use an `ItemWriter` to write data to the new system's database.

      ```java
      @Bean
      public Job migrationJob(JobBuilderFactory jobBuilderFactory, StepBuilderFactory stepBuilderFactory, ItemReader<LegacyCustomer> reader, ItemProcessor<LegacyCustomer, NewCustomer> processor, ItemWriter<NewCustomer> writer) {
          Step step = stepBuilderFactory.get("migration-step")
              .<LegacyCustomer, NewCustomer>chunk(100)
              .reader(reader)
              .processor(processor)
              .writer(writer)
              .build();
      
          return jobBuilderFactory.get("migration-job")
              .start(step)
              .build();
      }
      
      ```

      ---

    **Key features:**

    - **Chunk-Oriented Processing:** Processes large volumes of data in manageable chunks, improving performance and resource utilization.

    - **Declarative I/O:** Provides built-in readers and writers for various data sources (databases, files, etc.).

    - **Transaction Management:** Ensures data integrity and supports rollback in case of errors.

    - **Job Scheduling:** Integrates with various scheduling frameworks (e.g., Quartz) to automate job execution.

    - **Scalability:** Supports partitioning and parallel processing to handle large datasets efficiently.

11. How does Spring Batch work? you may include code snippet as part of your answer

    Spring Batch works by dividing a batch job into discrete steps, each performing a specific task such as reading data, processing it, and writing the output.

    **Core Concepts**

    1. **Job**: A job represents the entire batch process and is composed of one or more steps.
    2. **Step**: A step is a single phase of the job and typically includes reading, processing, and writing data.
    3. **JobInstance**: Represents a single execution of a job with a specific set of parameters.
    4. **JobExecution**: Represents a single run of a JobInstance.
    5. **StepExecution**: Represents the execution of a step in a job.
    6. **ItemReader**: Reads data from a source.
    7. **ItemProcessor**: Processes the data.
    8. **ItemWriter**: Writes the processed data to a destination.

    **Example**

    1. Define the domain model

       ```java
       public class Person {
           private String firstName;
           private String lastName;
       
           // getters and setters
       }
       ```

    2. Configure the ItemReader

       ```java
       @Bean
       public FlatFileItemReader<Person> reader() {
           return new FlatFileItemReaderBuilder<Person>()
                   .name("personItemReader")
                   .resource(new ClassPathResource("sample-data.csv"))
                   .delimited()
                   .names(new String[]{"firstName", "lastName"})
                   .fieldSetMapper(new BeanWrapperFieldSetMapper<>() {{
                       setTargetType(Person.class);
                   }})
                   .build();
       }
       ```

    3. Configure the ItemProcessor

       ```java
       @Bean
       public ItemProcessor<Person, Person> processor() {
           return person -> {
               person.setFirstName(person.getFirstName().toUpperCase());
               person.setLastName(person.getLastName().toUpperCase());
               return person;
           };
       }
       ```

    4. Configure the ItemWriter

       ```java
       @Bean
       public JdbcBatchItemWriter<Person> writer(DataSource dataSource) {
           return new JdbcBatchItemWriterBuilder<Person>()
                   .itemSqlParameterSourceProvider(new BeanPropertyItemSqlParameterSourceProvider<>())
                   .sql("INSERT INTO people (first_name, last_name) VALUES (:firstName, :lastName)")
                   .dataSource(dataSource)
                   .build();
       }
       ```

    5. Define job and steps

       ```java
       @Bean
       public Job importUserJob(JobBuilderFactory jobBuilderFactory, StepBuilderFactory stepBuilderFactory, ItemReader<Person> reader, ItemProcessor<Person, Person> processor, ItemWriter<Person> writer) {
           Step step = stepBuilderFactory.get("step1")
                   .<Person, Person>chunk(10)
                   .reader(reader)
                   .processor(processor)
                   .writer(writer)
                   .build();
       
           return jobBuilderFactory.get("importUserJob")
                   .start(step)
                   .build();
       }
       ```

    - **FlatFileItemReader**: Reads data from a CSV file. The `names` method specifies the field names, and `fieldSetMapper` maps the fields to the `Person` class.

    - **ItemProcessor**: Converts the first and last names to uppercase.

    - **JdbcBatchItemWriter**: Writes the processed data to a database table named `people`.

    - **Job and Step Configuration**: Defines a job with a single step. The step processes data in chunks of 10 items, using the defined reader, processor, and writer.

    **How it works**

    - **Job Execution**: When the job is launched, a `JobInstance` is created.

    - **Step Execution**: The job's step is executed. The `ItemReader` reads a chunk of items, the `ItemProcessor` processes each item, and the `ItemWriter` writes the processed items.

    - **Chunk-Oriented Processing**: The steps execute in chunks, ensuring efficient processing and transaction management.

    - **Transaction Management**: Each chunk is processed within a transaction. If an error occurs, the transaction is rolled back, and the job can be restarted from the last successful chunk.

    - **Job Restartability**: Spring Batch maintains state (using a database) to allow jobs to be restarted from the point of failure, ensuring data consistency.

    ```java
    @Configuration
    @EnableBatchProcessing
    public class BatchConfiguration {
    
        @Bean
        public FlatFileItemReader<Person> reader() {
            return new FlatFileItemReaderBuilder<Person>()
                    .name("personItemReader")
                    .resource(new ClassPathResource("sample-data.csv"))
                    .delimited()
                    .names(new String[]{"firstName", "lastName"})
                    .fieldSetMapper(new BeanWrapperFieldSetMapper<>() {{
                        setTargetType(Person.class);
                    }})
                    .build();
        }
    
        @Bean
        public ItemProcessor<Person, Person> processor() {
            return person -> {
                person.setFirstName(person.getFirstName().toUpperCase());
                person.setLastName(person.getLastName().toUpperCase());
                return person;
            };
        }
    
        @Bean
        public JdbcBatchItemWriter<Person> writer(DataSource dataSource) {
            return new JdbcBatchItemWriterBuilder<Person>()
                    .itemSqlParameterSourceProvider(new BeanPropertyItemSqlParameterSourceProvider<>())
                    .sql("INSERT INTO people (first_name, last_name) VALUES (:firstName, :lastName)")
                    .dataSource(dataSource)
                    .build();
        }
    
        @Bean
        public Job importUserJob(JobBuilderFactory jobBuilderFactory, StepBuilderFactory stepBuilderFactory, ItemReader<Person> reader, ItemProcessor<Person, Person> processor, ItemWriter<Person> writer) {
            Step step = stepBuilderFactory.get("step1")
                    .<Person, Person>chunk(10)
                    .reader(reader)
                    .processor(processor)
                    .writer(writer)
                    .build();
    
            return jobBuilderFactory.get("importUserJob")
                    .start(step)
                    .build();
        }
    }
    ```

12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?

    **Using Spring's `@Scheduled` Annotation**

    1. Add `@EnableScheduling` to your main application class to enable Spring's scheduling support.

    2. Create a scheduled method in a service class to launch the batch job.

       ```java
       @Service
       public class JobScheduler {
       
           private final JobLauncher jobLauncher;
           private final Job job;
       
           @Autowired
           public JobScheduler(JobLauncher jobLauncher, Job job) {
               this.jobLauncher = jobLauncher;
               this.job = job;
           }
       
           @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 2 * * ?") // Runs daily at 2 AM
           public void runJob() {
               JobParameters params = new JobParametersBuilder()
                       .addLong("time", System.currentTimeMillis())
                       .toJobParameters();
               try {
                   jobLauncher.run(job, params);
               } catch (JobExecutionException e) {
                   e.printStackTrace();
               }
           }
       }
       ```

13. What is the cron expression?

    A cron expression is a string representing a schedule in the Unix-like operating systems' cron job scheduler. It provides a concise way to define the specific times, dates, and intervals at which a task should run.

    **Format**

    A typical cron expression consists of six or seven fields, separated by spaces, which represent different time units:

    1. Seconds (0–59)
    2. Minutes (0–59)
    3. Hours (0–23)
    4. Day of month (1–31)
    5. Month (1–12 or JAN–DEC)
    6. Day of week (0–7 or SUN–SAT; both 0 and 7 represent Sunday)
    7. Year (optional, only Quartz uses this field)

    **Basic Symbols:**

    - `*` (asterisk): Represents all possible values for a field (e.g., every minute, every hour).
    - `,` (comma): Separates multiple values (e.g., `1,3,5` in the hours field means 1 AM, 3 AM, and 5 AM).
    - `-` (hyphen): Defines a range of values (e.g., `1-5` in the hours field means every hour from 1 to 5).
    - `/` (slash): Specifies increments (e.g., `0/15` in the minutes field means every 15 minutes starting at minute 0).
    - `?` (question mark): Used in the day of month and day of week fields to indicate no specific value (useful when specifying one without the other).
    - `L` (last): Used to specify the last day of the month or the last occurrence of a weekday (e.g., `L` in the day of month field means the last day of the month).
    - `W` (weekday): Used to specify the nearest weekday to a given day (e.g., `15W` means the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month).
    - `#` (hash): Used to specify the nth occurrence of a weekday in a month (e.g., `2#3` in the day of week field means the third Monday of the month).

14. Explain Spring task?

    Spring Task is a module within the Spring Framework that provides scheduling support. It allows you to execute tasks asynchronously and schedule tasks to run at specific times or intervals.

    **Key Features**

    - **@Scheduled Annotation**: Easily schedule tasks using cron expressions or fixed intervals.

    - **@Async Annotation**: Execute methods asynchronously.

    - **TaskExecutor and TaskScheduler**: Abstracts for managing task execution and scheduling.

    ---

    **Using Spring Task**

    1. **Enabling Scheduling**

    - To use scheduling features in a Spring application, you need to enable scheduling by adding `@EnableScheduling` to a configuration class.

    ```java
    import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
    import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableScheduling;
    
    @Configuration
    @EnableScheduling
    public class SchedulingConfig {
    }
    ```

    2. **Scheduling Tasks with `@Scheduled`**

    - You can use the `@Scheduled` annotation to define methods that should be executed according to a specified schedule.

    **Example: Fixed Rate Scheduling**

    ```java
    import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;
    import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
    
    @Component
    public class ScheduledTasks {
    
        @Scheduled(fixedRate = 5000) // Runs every 5 seconds
        public void fixedRateTask() {
            System.out.println("Fixed rate task - " + System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000);
        }
    
        @Scheduled(fixedDelay = 5000) // Runs 5 seconds after the previous execution completes
        public void fixedDelayTask() {
            System.out.println("Fixed delay task - " + System.currentTimeMillis / 1000);
        }
    
        @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 * * * ?") // Runs every hour at the start of the hour
        public void cronTask() {
            System.out.println("Cron task - " + System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000);
        }
    }
    ```

    - **Attributes of @Scheduled:**

      - `fixedRate`: Interval between the start of each execution.

      - `fixedDelay`: Interval between the end of one execution and the start of the next.

      - `initialDelay`: Delay before the first execution.

      - `cron`: Cron expression for specifying complex schedules.

    3. **Asynchronous Tasks with @Async**

    - The `@Async` annotation allows you to run methods asynchronously. This is useful for tasks that can run in parallel without blocking the main execution thread.

    **Example:**

    1. **Enable Async Support:**

    ```java
    import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
    import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableAsync;
    
    @Configuration
    @EnableAsync
    public class AsyncConfig {
    }
    ```

    2. **Define Asynchronous Methods:**

    ```java
    import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Async;
    import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
    
    @Service
    public class AsyncService {
    
        @Async
        public void asyncMethod() {
            System.out.println("Asynchronous method - " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
    }
    ```

    3. **Calling the Asynchronous Method:**

    ```java
    import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
    import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
    
    @Component
    public class AsyncCaller {
    
        @Autowired
        private AsyncService asyncService;
    
        public void callAsyncMethod() {
            asyncService.asyncMethod();
            System.out.println("Method called - " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
    }
    ```

    When `callAsyncMethod` is invoked, `asyncMethod` will run asynchronously, allowing `callAsyncMethod` to return immediately without waiting for `asyncMethod` to complete.

15. What is Filter and any filter example?

    In Spring, a filter is an object that performs filtering tasks on either the request to a resource (like a servlet or a static file) or on the response from a resource, or both. Filters can perform tasks such as logging, authentication, input validation, or other preprocessing and postprocessing tasks.

    ---

    **Key Points**

    - **Filter Interface**: Filters are defined by implementing the `javax.servlet.Filter` interface, which has three methods: `init`, `doFilter`, and `destroy`.
    - **FilterRegistrationBean**: In Spring Boot, filters can be registered using `FilterRegistrationBean`, which allows you to set the filter order, URL patterns, and other properties.
    - **Spring Security Filters**: If using Spring Security, many security-related filters are automatically configured and added to the filter chain.

    ---

    **Example of a Simple Filter**

    - Here’s an example of a simple logging filter in a Spring Boot application:
      1. Implementing the Filter

    ```java
    import javax.servlet.Filter;
    import javax.servlet.FilterChain;
    import javax.servlet.FilterConfig;
    import javax.servlet.ServletException;
    import javax.servlet.ServletRequest;
    import javax.servlet.ServletResponse;
    import java.io.IOException;
    import org.slf4j.Logger;
    import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
    
    public class CustomLoggingFilter implements Filter {
    
        private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(CustomLoggingFilter.class);
    
        @Override
        public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {
            // Initialization logic if needed
        }
    
        @Override
        public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
                throws IOException, ServletException {
            logger.info("Request received at " + request.getRemoteAddr());
            chain.doFilter(request, response);
            logger.info("Response sent to " + request.getRemoteAddr());
        }
    
        @Override
        public void destroy() {
            // Cleanup logic if needed
        }
    }
    ```

     	2. Registering the Filter in a Spring Boot Application
         - You can register the filter using a `@Configuration` class:

    ```java
    import org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.FilterRegistrationBean;
    import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
    import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
    
    @Configuration
    public class FilterConfig {
    
        @Bean
        public FilterRegistrationBean<CustomLoggingFilter> loggingFilter() {
            FilterRegistrationBean<CustomLoggingFilter> registrationBean = new FilterRegistrationBean<>();
            registrationBean.setFilter(new CustomLoggingFilter());
            registrationBean.addUrlPatterns("/api/*"); // Specify URL patterns to apply the filter to
            registrationBean.setOrder(1); // Set filter order if you have multiple filters
            return registrationBean;
        }
    }
    ```

16. What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?

    In Spring, an interceptor is a concept used to intercept and process HTTP requests and responses before they reach a controller or after the controller processes them. Interceptors are typically used for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, performance monitoring, or other tasks that need to be performed on every request or response.

    Interceptors are similar to filters but are more closely integrated with Spring's handler mapping mechanism, making them more suitable for tasks that require access to the request handling lifecycle.

    ---

    **Key Points of Interceptors in Spring:**

    1. **HandlerInterceptor Interface**: Interceptors in Spring are implemented using the `HandlerInterceptor` interface, which has three main methods:
       - `preHandle`: Called before the handler method is invoked. It can return `true` to continue processing or `false` to abort the request.
       - `postHandle`: Called after the handler method has been invoked, but before the view is rendered.
       - `afterCompletion`: Called after the complete request has finished, including rendering the view.
    2. **Interceptors in Spring MVC**: Interceptors can be registered in a Spring MVC application by adding them to the `InterceptorRegistry` in a configuration class.

    ---

    **Example**

    Here’s an example of a simple logging interceptor in a Spring Boot application:

    1. Implementing the Interceptor

    ```java
    import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
    import org.springframework.web.servlet.HandlerInterceptor;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
    
    @Component
    public class LoggingInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {
    
        @Override
        public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) throws Exception {
            System.out.println("Pre Handle method is Calling: " + request.getRequestURI());
            return true;
        }
    
        @Override
        public void postHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, ModelAndView modelAndView) throws Exception {
            System.out.println("Post Handle method is Calling: " + request.getRequestURI());
        }
    
        @Override
        public void afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, Exception exception) throws Exception {
            System.out.println("Request and Response is completed: " + request.getRequestURI());
        }
    }
    ```

    2. Registering the Interceptor

    - You can register the interceptor using a configuration class:

    ```java
    import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
    import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
    import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.InterceptorRegistry;
    import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.WebMvcConfigurer;
    
    @Configuration
    public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
    
        @Autowired
        private LoggingInterceptor loggingInterceptor;
    
        @Override
        public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
            registry.addInterceptor(loggingInterceptor).addPathPatterns("/api/**"); // Specify URL patterns to apply the interceptor to
        }
    }
    ```

17. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?

    In the context of Spring's `HandlerInterceptor` interface, `preHandle` and `postHandle` are two of the key methods that define the behavior of an interceptor. They allow you to perform operations before and after the handler (usually a controller method) is executed.

    ---

    **`preHandle` Method**

    The `preHandle` method is called before the actual handler (controller method) is executed. This method can be used to perform operations such as authentication, logging, or modifying the request before it reaches the handler.

    **Key Points:**

    - Parameters:
      - `HttpServletRequest request`: The current HTTP request.
      - `HttpServletResponse response`: The current HTTP response.
      - `Object handler`: The handler (or handler method) that will handle the request.
    - Return Value:
      - `boolean`: If the method returns `true`, the request processing proceeds to the next interceptor or the handler itself. If it returns `false`, the request processing is aborted, and the response is returned immediately.

    **Example Usage:**

    ```java
    @Override
    public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Pre Handle method is Calling: " + request.getRequestURI());
        
        // Example: Authentication check
        String authToken = request.getHeader("Authorization");
        if (authToken != null && validateToken(authToken)) {
            return true; // Continue with the request processing
        } else {
            response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED);
            return false; // Abort the request processing
        }
    }
    ```

    ---

    **`postHandle` Method**

    The `postHandle` method is called after the handler (controller method) has been executed, but before the view is rendered. This method can be used to add additional attributes to the model or modify the response before it is sent to the client.

    **Key Points:**

    - Parameters:
      - `HttpServletRequest request`: The current HTTP request.
      - `HttpServletResponse response`: The current HTTP response.
      - `Object handler`: The handler (or handler method) that handled the request.
      - `ModelAndView modelAndView`: The `ModelAndView` object that holds the model data and the view information. This can be modified as needed.

    **Example Usage:**

    ```java
    @Override
    public void postHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, ModelAndView modelAndView) throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Post Handle method is Calling: " + request.getRequestURI());
        
        // Example: Adding an attribute to the model
        if (modelAndView != null) {
            modelAndView.addObject("additionalAttribute", "value");
        }
    }
    ```

18. What is Swagger, why do we need it? What does it do except "documentation"?

    Swagger is an open-source framework that helps developers **design, build, document, and consume** RESTful web services

    **What Does Swagger Do Besides Documentation?**

    1. API Design:
       - **Swagger Editor**: A web-based editor that allows developers to design APIs using the OpenAPI Specification. It provides real-time feedback and helps validate the API design against the specification.
    2. Code Generation:
       - **Swagger Codegen**: Generates server stubs and client SDKs in various programming languages based on the API definition. This helps in quickly starting the development process and ensuring consistency between the API definition and the implementation.
    3. API Testing:
       - **Swagger Inspector**: An online tool for testing APIs. It allows you to call APIs directly from your browser, inspect the responses, and generate API definitions from the requests.
    4. API Documentation:
       - **Swagger UI**: Provides a web-based interface for interactive API documentation. It allows users to explore the API endpoints, see the request and response formats, and try out the API directly from the browser.
    5. API Management:
       - **SwaggerHub**: A collaborative platform for designing and documenting APIs. It integrates with other development tools and provides features for versioning, team collaboration, and lifecycle management of APIs.
    6. Integration:
       - **Tool Integration**: Swagger integrates with various tools and platforms, such as CI/CD pipelines, to automate API validation and testing. It can also integrate with API gateways and management platforms for better API lifecycle management.
