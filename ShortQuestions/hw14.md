3.  What is the Aspect Oriented Programming, explain it with detailed use cases?
AOP is a programming paradigm that allows you to modularize cross-cutting concerns in your application. These concerns are functionalities that span across multiple parts of your codebase, such as logging, security, caching, transaction management, and error handling.
Use Cases:

Logging: Log method calls, arguments, return values, and exceptions at specific points in your application.
Security: Enforce authorization checks, data validation, and auditing before method execution.
Caching: Cache frequently accessed data to improve performance.
Transaction Management: Ensure data consistency by managing database transactions across multiple method calls.
Error Handling: Implement centralized error handling and recovery mechanisms.

4.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
Advantages:
Improved Modularity: Separates cross-cutting concerns from core business logic, making code cleaner and more maintainable.
Reusability: Aspects can be reused across different parts of the application.
Loose Coupling: Changes in aspects don't directly affect business objects.

Disadvantages:
Increased Complexity: Can add complexity to the codebase, especially for beginners.
Performance Overhead: Introducing additional logic at runtime can lead to slight performance overhead.

5.  Explain following concept in your own words, you may include code snippet as part of your answer.
1.  Aspect: An aspect encapsulates a cross-cutting concern. It consists of advice and pointcuts.
@Aspect
public class LoggingAspect {
    // Advice and pointcut definitions here
}
2.  PointCut: A pointcut specifies which join points (method executions, field accesses, etc.) the advice should be applied to. It's like a filter for join points.
<aop:pointcut id="businessServiceMethods" expression="execution(* com.example.service.BusinessService+.*(..))" />

3.  JoinPoint: A specific point during program execution where advice can be applied. In Spring AOP, joinpoints are typically method executions.
4.  Advice: Actions to be taken at joinpoints defined by a pointcut. There are different types of advice
Before advice: Runs before the target method execution.
After advice: Runs after the target method execution, regardless of whether it throws an exception.
After returning advice: Runs after the target method execution only if it completes successfully.
After throwing advice: Runs after the target method throws an exception.
Around advice: Surrounds the target method execution, allowing for more control over the execution flow.

6.  How do we declare a pointcut, can we declare it without annotating an empty method? Name some 
expressions to do it.
execution(modifiers returnType packageName.className methodName(*)): Matches method executions based on modifiers, return type, package, class, and method name (wildcards can be used for arguments).
within(packageName.className): Matches execution within a specific class or package.
args(argumentType) or args(argumentType1, argumentType2): Matches methods based on argument types.

7.  Compare different types of advices in Spring AOP.
Before Advice: Runs before the target method execution.
After Advice: Runs after the target method execution, regardless of exceptions.
After Returning Advice: Runs after the target method execution if it completes successfully.
After Throwing Advice: Runs after the target method throws an exception.
Around Advice: Surrounds the target method execution, allowing for more control over the execution flow.

9.  Spring WebFlux vs Stream API+CompletableFuture, why use Spring WebFlux over the other?
Spring WebFlux: Choose WebFlux for high-concurrency, non-blocking web applications that handle many concurrent requests efficiently. It uses reactive streams for asynchronous and back-pressured data processing.
Stream API + CompletableFuture: Suitable for simpler asynchronous tasks or when you already have a Java 8+ environment and don't need the full framework features of WebFlux.

10.  When to use Spring Batch? please provide detailed exaples with business context.
Use Spring Batch for batch processing tasks that involve large volumes of data, such as:

Data migration: Moving data from one system to another.
Data warehousing: Preparing data for analysis.
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Extracting data from various sources, transforming it, and loading it into a target system.
Job scheduling: Automating repetitive batch tasks.
Example: A bank might use Spring Batch to process nightly transactions, updating customer accounts, generating reports, etc.

11.  How does Spring Batch work? you may include code snippet as part of your answer.
Spring Batch follows a batch processing pattern with stages:
Job: A high-level definition of the entire batch process.
Steps: Individual units of work within the job (e.g., reading data, processing data, writing data).
Tasks: Reusable processing elements within steps.
Items: Individual data units processed by tasks.

12.  How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
Use a scheduler like Spring Scheduler or Quartz to schedule Spring Batch jobs.

13.  What is the cron expression?
A cron expression defines scheduling patterns with fields for minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week, and year (optional).

14.  Explain Spring task? 
Spring Task provides a simplified way to schedule asynchronous tasks using annotations like @Scheduled or @Async.

15.  What is Filter and any filter example?
A filter is an interceptor that intercepts requests and responses in a web application. It can perform tasks like authentication, authorization, logging, or modifying request/response data.
Example: A security filter that checks for a valid login token before allowing access to a resource.

16.  What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?
An interceptor is a design pattern for intercepting method calls or requests before and after their execution. It allows for centralized processing at specific points in the application flow.
With interceptors, you can:
Implement logging
Perform security checks
Validate input data

17.  In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?
preHandle: Invoked before a method is called. Can be used for tasks like authorization or data validation.
postHandle: Invoked after a method is called, but before the response is sent. Can be used for logging or modifying the response.

18.  What is Swagger, why do we need it? What does it do except "documentation"?
Swagger is an open-source framework for generating API documentation. It provides interactive APIs for developers to explore and understand your application's functionality.
Benefits:
Improves developer experience
Reduces manual documentation efforts
Enables automated API testing
