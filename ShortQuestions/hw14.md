# Homework 46 AOP & Batch & Swagger

## Yirun Wang

### 2. Briefly reading:https://www.techgeeknext.com/spring-boot/spring-aop-interview-questions

### 3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming, explain it with detailed use cases?

AOP addresses the problem of *cross-cutting concerns*, which would be any kind of code that is repeated in different methods and can't normally be completely refactored into its own module, like with logging or verification.

AOP is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. It does so by adding additional behavior to existing code without modifying the code itself, instead using a mechanism called "advice" and "aspects."

**Use Case:**

1. Logging

You want to add logging to several methods in your application to track their execution without modifying the methods themselves. Use an aspect to define a pointcut that matches the methods and advice to log the execution details.

```java
@Aspect
public class LoggingAspect {
    @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Method " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName() + " is called.");
    }
}

```

2. Transaction Management

You need to ensure that transactions are properly managed (committed or rolled back) across various methods in a service layer. Use an aspect to define a pointcut that matches the transactional methods and advice to manage the transaction. 

```java
@Aspect
public class TransactionAspect {
    @Around("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public Object manageTransaction(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
        // Start transaction
        try {
            Object result = joinPoint.proceed();
            // Commit transaction
            return result;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Rollback transaction
            throw e;
        }
    }
}

```

### 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of SpringAOP?

Advantages of Spring AOP

1. **Ease of Configuration**: Spring AOP is straightforward to set up, making it accessible for developers.
2. **Pure Java Implementation**: It is implemented entirely in Java, eliminating the need for separate compilation units or class loaders.
3. **Integration with Spring IOC**: Utilizes Spring's Inversion of Control (IOC) container for dependency injection, enhancing modularity and manageability.
4. **Flexible Aspect Creation**: Aspects can be created using either the `@AspectJ` annotation or XML configuration, providing flexibility in how cross-cutting concerns are defined.
5. **Seamless Integration**: Integrates cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transaction management into the application classes without modifying their core logic.

Disadvantages of Spring AOP

1. **Debugging Challenges**: Debugging code that uses the AOP framework can be more complex compared to traditional approaches.
2. **Visibility Limitations**: Only public methods can be advised; methods with private, protected, or default visibility cannot be intercepted by aspects.
3. **Aspect Interdependency**: Aspects cannot be advised by other aspects. Once a class is marked as an aspect, Spring prevents it from being auto-proxied, limiting the layering of aspects.

### 5. Explain the following concepts in your own words, you may include code snippet as part of your answer.

**Aspect:**

An aspect is a modular unit that encapsulates cross-cutting concerns (like logging or security) and applies them to specific points in program execution without modifying the core business logic.

**Advice**:

The code that is executed when a join point is reached. Types of advice include: Before, After, Around.

**Joint Point**:

A point in the program execution where an aspect can be applied, such as method calls or executions. A joinpoint is a *candidate* point in the **Program Execution** of the application where an aspect can be plugged in. This point could be a method being called

**Pointcut**:

An expression that matches join points, specifying where the advice should be applied. A pointcut defines at what joinpoints, the associated Advice should be applied. 

**Weaving**:

The process of applying aspects to a target object to create an advised object. This can occur at compile time, load time, or runtime.

```java
// Security Aspect with Before Advice

@Aspect
@Component
public class SecurityAspect {

    @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void checkSecurity(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        // Perform security check
        if (!isUserAuthorized()) {
            throw new SecurityException("User is not authorized");
        }
    }

    private boolean isUserAuthorized() {
        // Implement your security check logic here
        return true; // Placeholder
    }
}

```



### 6. How do we declare a pointcut, can we declare it without annotating an empty method? Name some expressions to do it.

Using annotation on advice methods.

1. Execution expresson

```java
@Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
    System.out.println("Method " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName() + " is called.");
}

```

2. Within expression: within certain types.
3. Args expression: This expression matches methods based on their arguments.
4. This expression：This expression matches join points where the proxy object is an instance of the given type. `@Before("this(com.example.service.MyService)")`
5. Target: This expression matches join points where the target object is an instance of the given type. `@Before("target(com.example.service.MyService)")`
6. @Before("target(com.example.service.MyService)"
7. Annotation： This expression matches methods annotated with a specific annotation. `@Before("@annotation(com.example.annotation.Loggable)")`

If using @Pointcut, it is:

```java
import org.aspectj.lang.JoinPoint;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Pointcut("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void serviceLayer() {}

    @Before("serviceLayer()")
    public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Method " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName() + " is called.");
    }

    @After("serviceLayer()")
    public void logAfter(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Method " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName() + " has finished.");
    }
}
```

### 7. Compare different types of advices in SpringAOP.

1. before: executes before the method call.

2. after: executes after the method call, regardless of its outcome.

3. after returning: executes after the method call if it completes successfully.

4. after throwing: executes if the method call throws an exception.

5. around: wraps the method call, allowing custom behavior before and after, and the ability to prevent the method call.

   ```java
   @Aspect
   @Component
   public class LoggingAspect {
   
       @Around("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
       public Object logAround(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
           System.out.println("Method " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName() + " is about to be called.");
           Object result = joinPoint.proceed(); // Proceed with the method execution
           System.out.println("Method " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName() + " has completed.");
           return result;
       }
   }
   ```

### 9. Spring WebFlux vs StreamAPI+CompletableFuture, **why use Spring WebFlux over the other?**

They are both used to handle high concurrency tasks asynchronous.

- **WebFlux**

**Reactive Streams**: Built on the Reactive Streams API, it provides a powerful way to handle asynchronous data streams.

**Non-blocking I/O**: Uses non-blocking I/O operations, making it highly scalable and efficient in handling a large number of concurrent connections.

**Functional Endpoints**: Supports both annotated controllers (similar to Spring MVC) and functional programming style endpoints.

**Integration with Reactor**: Uses Project Reactor for its reactive capabilities, providing a rich set of operators and tools for reactive programming.

**Backpressure Handling**: Automatically manages backpressure, which is crucial for controlling the flow of data in reactive systems.

- **StreamAPI + CompletableFuture**

**Stream API**: Provides a declarative way to process sequences of elements (like collections) with operations such as map, filter, and reduce.

**CompletableFuture**: Enables asynchronous programming by allowing tasks to be run asynchronously and to compose multiple stages of computation.

**Parallel Streams**: Streams can be processed in parallel to take advantage of multiple CPU cores, providing a simple way to parallelize processing.

- Why Spring WebFlux

Spring WebFlux is designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently with non-blocking I/O. Ideal for reactive web applications and microservices that need to communicate efficiently with other services and handle high loads.

Part of the broader Spring ecosystem, providing seamless integration with other Spring projects.

- When to use StreamAPI + Completable Furure

**Asynchronous Processing**: For asynchronous computations within a single application, especially when working with CPU-bound tasks.

**Simple Use Cases**: For smaller projects or simpler asynchronous tasks where the overhead of introducing a full reactive framework is unnecessary.

**Parallel Data Processing**: When you need to process large data sets in parallel, the Stream API is very effective.

### 10. When to use Spring Batch? please provide detailed exaples with business context.

Spring Batch is a lightweight, comprehensive framework designed to facilitate the development of robust batch applications. It also provides more advanced technical services and features that support extremely high volume and high performance batch jobs through its optimization and partitioning techniques.

1. Data Migration

**Business Context**: A retail company is migrating customer and order data from an old legacy system to a new modern database. This involves reading data from flat files, transforming it to match the new schema, and writing it to the new database.

**Step 1: Read Data**: Use an `ItemReader` to read data from CSV files containing customer and order information.

**Step 2: Transform Data**: Use an `ItemProcessor` to transform the data to the new database schema.

**Step 3: Write Data**: Use an `ItemWriter` to write the transformed data to the new database.

```java
@Configuration
@EnableBatchProcessing
public class BatchConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public FlatFileItemReader<Customer> reader() {
        return new FlatFileItemReaderBuilder<Customer>()
            .name("customerItemReader")
            .resource(new ClassPathResource("customers.csv"))
            .delimited()
            .names(new String[]{"firstName", "lastName", "email"})
            .fieldSetMapper(new BeanWrapperFieldSetMapper<Customer>() {{
                setTargetType(Customer.class);
            }})
            .build();
    }

    @Bean
    public ItemProcessor<Customer, Customer> processor() {
        return new CustomerItemProcessor();
    }

    @Bean
    public JdbcBatchItemWriter<Customer> writer(DataSource dataSource) {
        return new JdbcBatchItemWriterBuilder<Customer>()
            .itemSqlParameterSourceProvider(new BeanPropertyItemSqlParameterSourceProvider<>())
            .sql("INSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, email) VALUES (:firstName, :lastName, :email)")
            .dataSource(dataSource)
            .build();
    }

    @Bean
    public Job importUserJob(JobCompletionNotificationListener listener, Step step1) {
        return jobBuilderFactory.get("importUserJob")
            .incrementer(new RunIdIncrementer())
            .listener(listener)
            .flow(step1)
            .end()
            .build();
    }

    @Bean
    public Step step1(JdbcBatchItemWriter<Customer> writer) {
        return stepBuilderFactory.get("step1")
            .<Customer, Customer>chunk(10)
            .reader(reader())
            .processor(processor())
            .writer(writer)
            .build();
    }
}

```

2. End-of-Day Financial Processing

**Business Context**: A bank needs to perform end-of-day processing to reconcile transactions, generate reports, and update account balances. This process needs to ensure data consistency and handle any errors gracefully.

**Step 1: Read Transactions**: Use an `ItemReader` to read transactions from the database.

**Step 2: Process Transactions**: Use an `ItemProcessor` to validate and apply business rules to each transaction.

**Step 3: Write Results**: Use an `ItemWriter` to update account balances and generate reports.

```java
@Configuration
@EnableBatchProcessing
public class FinancialBatchConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public JdbcCursorItemReader<Transaction> reader(DataSource dataSource) {
        return new JdbcCursorItemReaderBuilder<Transaction>()
            .dataSource(dataSource)
            .name("transactionItemReader")
            .sql("SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE status = 'PENDING'")
            .rowMapper(new BeanPropertyRowMapper<>(Transaction.class))
            .build();
    }

    @Bean
    public ItemProcessor<Transaction, Account> processor() {
        return new TransactionItemProcessor();
    }

    @Bean
    public CompositeItemWriter<Account> writer(DataSource dataSource) {
        JdbcBatchItemWriter<Account> accountWriter = new JdbcBatchItemWriterBuilder<Account>()
            .itemSqlParameterSourceProvider(new BeanPropertyItemSqlParameterSourceProvider<>())
            .sql("UPDATE accounts SET balance = :balance WHERE id = :id")
            .dataSource(dataSource)
            .build();

        FlatFileItemWriter<TransactionReport> reportWriter = new FlatFileItemWriterBuilder<TransactionReport>()
            .name("transactionReportWriter")
            .resource(new FileSystemResource("reports/transactions.csv"))
            .delimited()
            .delimiter(",")
            .names(new String[]{"transactionId", "status", "message"})
            .build();

        return new CompositeItemWriterBuilder<Account>()
            .delegates(accountWriter, reportWriter)
            .build();
    }

    @Bean
    public Job financialJob(JobCompletionNotificationListener listener, Step step1) {
        return jobBuilderFactory.get("financialJob")
            .incrementer(new RunIdIncrementer())
            .listener(listener)
            .flow(step1)
            .end()
            .build();
    }

    @Bean
    public Step step1(CompositeItemWriter<Account> writer) {
        return stepBuilderFactory.get("step1")
            .<Transaction, Account>chunk(10)
            .reader(reader(null))
            .processor(processor())
            .writer(writer)
            .build();
    }
}

```

### 11. How does Spring Batch work? you may include code snippet as part of your answer.

A batch process is typically encapsulated by a `Job` consisting of multiple `Step`s. 

Each `Step` typically has a single `ItemReader`, `ItemProcessor`, and `ItemWriter`. 

A `Job` is executed by a `JobLauncher`, and metadata about configured and executed jobs is stored in a `JobRepository`.

Each `Job` may be associated with multiple `JobInstance`s, each of which is defined uniquely by its particular `JobParameters` that are used to start a batch job. Each run of a `JobInstance` is referred to as a `JobExecution`. Each `JobExecution` typically tracks what happened during a run, such as current and exit statuses, start and end times, etc.

**Execution Flow:**

**Job Initialization**: The batch job starts with the initialization of a `Job` object, which encapsulates the entire batch process.

**Step Execution**: Each `Job` consists of multiple `Step` objects. Each step executes in a sequence or parallel based on the job configuration. Steps can be conditional, allowing for complex job flows.

**Chunk-Oriented Processing**:

- **Reading**: The `ItemReader` reads a chunk of data from the source.
- **Processing**: The `ItemProcessor` processes each item read.
- **Writing**: The `ItemWriter` writes the processed items to the destination.
- This read-process-write cycle continues until all data is processed.

**Transaction Management**: Each chunk is processed within a transaction. If an error occurs, the transaction is rolled back, and the chunk is retried based on the retry policy.

**Job and Step Monitoring**: `JobExecution` and `StepExecution` objects track the status and metrics of the job and steps. This information is stored in the `JobRepository`.

**Job Completion**: Once all steps are executed, the job status is updated to indicate success or failure. Notifications or follow-up actions can be triggered based on the job outcome.

```java
@Configuration
@EnableBatchProcessing
public class BatchConfiguration {

    @Autowired
    private JobBuilderFactory jobBuilderFactory;

    @Autowired
    private StepBuilderFactory stepBuilderFactory;

    @Autowired
    private DataSource dataSource;

    @Bean
    public FlatFileItemReader<Customer> reader() {
        return new FlatFileItemReaderBuilder<Customer>()
            .name("customerItemReader")
            .resource(new ClassPathResource("customers.csv"))
            .delimited()
            .names("firstName", "lastName", "email")
            .fieldSetMapper(new BeanWrapperFieldSetMapper<Customer>() {{
                setTargetType(Customer.class);
            }})
            .build();
    }

    @Bean
    public ItemProcessor<Customer, Customer> processor() {
        return new CustomerItemProcessor();
    }

    @Bean
    public JdbcBatchItemWriter<Customer> writer() {
        return new JdbcBatchItemWriterBuilder<Customer>()
            .itemSqlParameterSourceProvider(new BeanPropertyItemSqlParameterSourceProvider<>())
            .sql("INSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, email) VALUES (:firstName, :lastName, :email)")
            .dataSource(dataSource)
            .build();
    }

    @Bean
    public Job importUserJob(JobCompletionNotificationListener listener, Step step1) {
        return jobBuilderFactory.get("importUserJob")
            .incrementer(new RunIdIncrementer())
            .listener(listener)
            .flow(step1)
            .end()
            .build();
    }

    @Bean
    public Step step1(JdbcBatchItemWriter<Customer> writer) {
        return stepBuilderFactory.get("step1")
            .<Customer, Customer>chunk(10)
            .reader(reader())
            .processor(processor())
            .writer(writer)
            .build();
    }
}

```

ItemProcessor Implementation:

```java
public class CustomerItemProcessor implements ItemProcessor<Customer, Customer> {

    @Override
    public Customer process(Customer customer) throws Exception {
        String firstName = customer.getFirstName().toUpperCase();
        String lastName = customer.getLastName().toUpperCase();
        customer.setFirstName(firstName);
        customer.setLastName(lastName);
        return customer;
    }
}

```

Job Completion Notification Listener:

```java
public class JobCompletionNotificationListener extends JobExecutionListenerSupport {

    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(JobCompletionNotificationListener.class);

    private final JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

    @Autowired
    public JobCompletionNotificationListener(JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate) {
        this.jdbcTemplate = jdbcTemplate;
    }

    @Override
    public void afterJob(JobExecution jobExecution) {
        if(jobExecution.getStatus() == BatchStatus.COMPLETED) {
            log.info("!!! JOB FINISHED! Time to verify the results");

            jdbcTemplate.query("SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM customers",
                (rs, row) -> new Customer(
                    rs.getString(1),
                    rs.getString(2),
                    rs.getString(3))
            ).forEach(customer -> log.info("Found <" + customer + "> in the database."));
        }
    }
}

```

### 12. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?

1.  @Scheduled

   Annotate a method with `@Scheduled` and specify the schedule using a cron expression, fixed delay, or fixed rate.

```java
@Configuration
@EnableScheduling
public class SchedulingConfig {
    // Configuration beans
}

```

Create a Scheduled Job Launcher: 

```java
@Service
public class JobScheduler {

    @Autowired
    private JobLauncher jobLauncher;

    @Autowired
    private Job importUserJob;

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 12 * * ?") // Runs every day at 12 PM
    public void runJob() {
        try {
            JobParameters jobParameters = new JobParametersBuilder()
                    .addLong("startAt", System.currentTimeMillis())
                    .toJobParameters();
            jobLauncher.run(importUserJob, jobParameters);
        } catch (JobExecutionException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

```
### 13. What is the cron expression?

six or seven fields separated by spaces that define a schedule for executing a job

```
* * * * * *
| | | | | |
| | | | | +-- Year (optional)
| | | | +---- Day of the week (0 - 7) (Sunday is both 0 and 7)
| | | +------ Month (1 - 12)
| | +-------- Day of the month (1 - 31)
| +---------- Hour (0 - 23)
+------------ Minute (0 - 59)

```

### 14. Explain Spring task?

Spring Task is a feature of the Spring Framework that provides support for scheduling and managing tasks in a Spring application.

**Annotation-Based Scheduling**: Simplifies task scheduling with annotations like `@Scheduled`.

**Task Executors**: Manages asynchronous task execution using `TaskExecutor` and `TaskScheduler` interfaces.

**Integration with Quartz**: Allows integration with Quartz Scheduler for advanced scheduling needs.

**Thread Pool Management**: Supports configuring thread pools for handling concurrent tasks.

### 15. What is Filter and any filter example?

In Spring, filters can be used to perform various tasks such as logging, authentication, authorization, input validation, and modifying request or response headers. 

**Interception**: Filters intercept HTTP requests and responses before they reach the controller or after the controller processes them.

**Configuration**: Filters can be configured to apply to specific URL patterns.

**Chaining**: Multiple filters can be chained together to apply a series of operations on a request or response.

**Integration with Spring Security**: Filters can be used in conjunction with Spring Security to manage authentication and authorization.

**Example of a Filter for Authentication in Spring Security:**

Step 1: Implementing the Custom Authentication Filter

```java
public class CustomAuthenticationFilter extends UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter {

    private final AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;

    public CustomAuthenticationFilter(AuthenticationManager authenticationManager) {
        this.authenticationManager = authenticationManager;
        setFilterProcessesUrl("/login"); // Set custom login URL if needed
    }

    @Override
    public Authentication attemptAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws AuthenticationException {
        String username = request.getParameter("username");
        String password = request.getParameter("password");

        UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authenticationToken =
                new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(username, password);

        return authenticationManager.authenticate(authenticationToken);
    }

    @Override
    protected void successfulAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain chain,
                                            Authentication authResult) throws IOException, ServletException {
        // Custom logic for successful authentication (e.g., generate JWT token)
        super.successfulAuthentication(request, response, chain, authResult);
    }
}
```

**Step 2: Configuring the Custom Authentication Filter**

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.csrf().disable()
            .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/login").permitAll()
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .addFilter(new CustomAuthenticationFilter(authenticationManagerBean()))
            .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS);
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
            .withUser("user")
            .password(passwordEncoder().encode("password"))
            .roles("USER");
    }

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }

    @Bean
    @Override
    public AuthenticationManager authenticationManagerBean() throws Exception {
        return super.authenticationManagerBean();
    }
}
```

### 16. What is the Interceptor? What we can do with interceptor?

In Spring, an interceptor is a mechanism used to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests and responses in a manner similar to filters, but with more fine-grained control over the request handling process.

**Pre-Processing**: Execute logic before the request reaches the controller (e.g., checking user authentication).

**Post-Processing**: Execute logic after the controller processes the request but before the view is rendered (e.g., modifying the response attributes).

**After Completion**: Execute logic after the complete request has finished processing, useful for cleanup activities.

**Differences Between Interceptors and Filters**

- **Scope**: Interceptors are specific to Spring MVC and work within the Spring context, while filters are part of the Servlet API and can be used in any Java web application.
- **Granularity**: Interceptors provide more fine-grained control with methods for pre-processing, post-processing, and after-completion logic. Filters typically only offer pre-processing and post-processing.
- **Ordering**: Interceptors can be ordered easily within Spring, whereas filters follow the order defined in the web.xml or Spring Boot configuration.

**Example of Using Interceptor for Authentication**

```java
@Component
public class AuthInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {

    @Override
    public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) throws Exception {
        // Check if the user is authenticated
        HttpSession session = request.getSession(false);
        if (session != null && session.getAttribute("user") != null) {
            return true; // User is authenticated, proceed to the controller
        } else {
            response.sendRedirect("/login"); // Redirect to login page
            return false; // Stop further processing
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void postHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler,
                           ModelAndView modelAndView) throws Exception {
        // Additional processing after the handler is executed
    }

    @Override
    public void afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler, Exception exception)
            throws Exception {
        // Cleanup actions after request completion
    }
}

```

### 17. In Interceptor, What is preHandle? What is postHandle?

**PreHandle:**

Executed before the request reaches the controller.

Return `true`: Continue with the request processing chain.

`false`: Halt the request processing chain (e.g., if the user is not authenticated).

**PostHandle:**

Executed after the controller has processed the request but before the view is rendered.

Modifying the `ModelAndView` object, adding additional attributes to the model, post-processing after business logic execution.

### 18. What is Swagger, why do we need it? What does it do except "documentation"?

Swagger is an open-source framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services.

**Benefits of Using Swagger:**

1. **Interactive Documentation**: Developers can explore and test the API endpoints interactively.
2. **Standardization**: Provides a standardized way of documenting APIs.
3. **Code Generation**: Facilitates the generation of client SDKs, server stubs, and API documentation.
4. **Ease of Use**: Simplifies API design and maintenance

Beyond documentation, Swagger offers interactive API exploration, code generation, API design and mocking, validation, testing, CI/CD integration, and framework support. These features streamline the development process, ensure API quality, and facilitate better API management and consumption.
