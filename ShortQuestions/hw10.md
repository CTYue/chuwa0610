1. 
@Component

@Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component. It can be used to annotate classes that will be automatically detected through classpath scanning.

@Service

@Service is a specialization of @Component. It is used to annotate service classes, which typically contain business logic.

@Controller

@Controller is a specialization of @Component. It is used to define a controller class in Spring MVC, which can handle web requests.

@Repository

@Repository is a specialization of @Component. It is used to annotate DAO classes that interact with the database.

2. 
#### @Configuration
`@Configuration` is an annotation that indicates that the class has `@Bean` definition methods. It is a configuration class that can be used by the Spring IoC container as a source of bean definitions.

#### @Bean
@Bean is an annotation applied at the method level. It tells Spring that a method annotated with @Bean will return an object that should be registered as a bean in the Spring application context.

3. 
In Spring, exceptions can be handled using several approaches, including @ExceptionHandler, @ControllerAdvice, and the HandlerExceptionResolver.

Ensuring You Do Not Expose Sensitive Information:
- Custom Error Messages: Always use generic error messages for exceptions that might expose sensitive information. Provide a user-friendly message instead.
- Logging: Log the detailed error message and stack trace to a secure location for debugging purposes, but do not return these details to the client.
- Custom Error Objects: Use custom error objects to structure your error responses without exposing sensitive information.
- HTTP Status Codes: Use appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the nature of the error.

4. 
Spring provides robust support for validating data in your applications. Validation can be applied to method parameters, form inputs, and other data sources to ensure data integrity and correctness.

#### Using Spring's Validation Framework
- Bean Validation API (JSR 380): Spring integrates with the Bean Validation API to provide declarative validation capabilities. You can use annotations to specify validation rules directly in your model classes.

- Custom Validators: Implement custom validation logic by creating custom validator classes.

#### Validation Annotations
- Here are some common validation annotations provided by the Bean Validation API:

- @NotNull: Ensures that the annotated field is not null.
- @NotEmpty: Ensures that the annotated field is not empty (i.e., not null and not an empty string).
- @NotBlank: Ensures that the annotated field is not blank (i.e., not null and not only whitespace).
- @Size: Specifies the size constraints for a field (e.g., @Size(min=2, max=30)).
- @Min: Ensures that the annotated field has a value no less than the specified minimum.
@Max: Ensures that the annotated field has a value no greater than the specified maximum.
@Pattern: Ensures that the annotated field matches the specified regular expression.
@Email: Ensures that the annotated field is a valid email address.
@Past: Ensures that the annotated field is a date in the past.
@Future: Ensures that the annotated field is a date in the future.

#### Purpose of Validation
The primary purpose of validation is to ensure that data adheres to defined rules and constraints before processing it further. This helps in:

- Data Integrity: Ensures that the data is correct and follows the expected format and constraints.
- Error Prevention: Prevents errors and exceptions that can occur due to invalid data.
- Security: Protects against security vulnerabilities by validating inputs and preventing malicious data.
- User Feedback: Provides immediate feedback to users about any issues with their input, enhancing the user experience.
