## 2. what is the @configuration and @bean?
`@Configuration` declares class as full configuration class. The class must be non-final and public. It is specifically used to define bean definitions and manage bean lifecycle. The class annotated with `@Configuration` should contains methods annotated with `@Bean`, and each method's return value is registered as a bean.  
`@Bean` is used to declare an object that is managed by the Spring framework. Spring framework takes care of instantiation, configuration, and wiring up objects.

## 3. How do you handle the exceptions in Spring? How do you make sure you do NOT expose sensitive information?
We can first create an ErrorDetails class:
```
@ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorDetails>
handleResourceNotFoundException(ResourceNotFoundException exception, WebRequest webRequest) {
   ErrorDetails errorDetails = new ErrorDetails(new Date(),    exception.getMessage(),webRequest.getDescription(false));
   return new ResponseEntity<>(errorDetails, HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
}
```
Then, we can create a GlobalExceptionHandler class:
```
@ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
public ResponseEntity<ErrorDetails> handleGlobalException(Exception exception, WebRequest webRequest) {
    ErrorDetails errorDetails = new ErrorDetails(new Date(), exception.getMessage(),webRequest.getDescription(false));
    return new ResponseEntity<>(errorDetails, HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
}
```
Also, we should add `server.error.include-stacktrace=never` in the application.properties file to aviod exposing sensitive information to the clients.

## 4. How do you do validations in Spring?List some validation annotaitons you know. What's the purpose of validation?
1. First, import spring boot starter validation dependency in pom.xml file.
2. Add validation rules to payload:
```
@NotEmtpy
@Size(min = 2, message = "Post title should have at least 2 characters")
private String title;
```
3. Add `@Valid` annotation to controller to apply the rule:
```
@PostMapping
public ResponseEntity<PostDto> createPost(@Valid @RequestBody PostDto postDto) {
   return new ResponseEntity<>(postService.createPost(postDto), HttpStatus.CREATED);
}
```

## 5. What is the actuator, list some endpoints and payload it provides?
Actuator brings production-ready features to our application, including monitoring our app, gathering metrics, and understanding traffic or the state of our database becomes trivial with this dependency.  
The actuator mainly exposes operational information about the running application — health, metrics, info, dump, env, etc. It uses HTTP endpoints or JMX beans to enable us to interact with it.
### Endpoints
- /auditevents lists security audit-related events such as user login/logout. Also, we can filter by principal or type among other fields.
- /beans returns all available beans in our BeanFactory. Unlike /auditevents, it doesn’t support filtering.
- /conditions, formerly known as /autoconfig, builds a report of conditions around autoconfiguration.
- /configprops allows us to fetch all @ConfigurationProperties beans.
- /env returns the current environment properties. Additionally, we can retrieve single properties.
- /flyway provides details about our Flyway database migrations.
- /health summarizes the health status of our application.
- /heapdump builds and returns a heap dump from the JVM used by our application.
- /info returns general information. It might be custom data, build information or details about the latest commit.
- /liquibase behaves like /flyway but for Liquibase.
- /logfile returns ordinary application logs.
- /loggers enables us to query and modify the logging level of our application.
- /metrics details metrics of our application. This might include generic metrics as well as custom ones.
- /prometheus returns metrics like the previous one, but formatted to work with a Prometheus server.
- /scheduledtasks provides details about every scheduled task within our application.
- /sessions lists HTTP sessions, given we are using Spring Session.
- /shutdown performs a graceful shutdown of the application.
- /threaddump dumps the thread information of the underlying JVM.
