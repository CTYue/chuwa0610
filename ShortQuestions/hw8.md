## Question 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 are submitted in homework 7 submission.

## 7. Whatâ€™s the naming differences between GraphQL vs. REST ? Why is the differences?
The first difference between GraphQL and REST is that GraphQL allows deviated data from original data. GraphQL is able to return a subset of data. In contrast, REST would return the entire data.  
The second difference is that GraphQL can retrieve data from multiple resources(APIs, databases) with a single query. With REST, users need to make more requests in order to retrieve the complete results.

## 8. Provide 2 real-world examples of N+1 problem in REST that can be solved by GraphQL. 
1. Social Media Feeds:  
In a social media app, fetch a user's feed with REST API normal would start with retrieve a list of posts from a `/posts` endpoint. Then, the app would fetch the details for each post with a `/posts/{id}` endpoint. Additionally, it might need to get the comments from `/posts/{id}/comments` endpoint. With GraphQL, the app can use a single query to fetch all the posts, details and comments.
2. E-commerce Website
The app would first get a list of products from `/products` endpoint. For each product, the app needs to send requests to `/products/{id}/inventory`, `/products/{id}/vendor`, `/products/{id}/reviews`, and etc. The GraphQL can also fetch all those informations with one single query.
