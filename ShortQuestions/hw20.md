## 2. Compare `let` vs `var` with your own code examples.
`let` is block-scoped, `var` is function-scoped. Both `var` and `let` are hoisted, but `var` is initialized with `undefined`. `let` is not initialized and cannot be accessed before declaration. `var` can be redeclared in the same scope, `let` cannot.
```
var varVariable = 'First declaration';
var varVariable = 'Second declaration'; // No error

let letVariable = 'First declaration';
let letVariable = 'Second declaration'; // Uncaught SyntaxError
```

## 5. Explain Event Loop, Macrotask, and Microtask with code samples
The Event Loop is responsible for executing code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued tasks in JavaScript's runtime. It continuously checks the call stack to see if thereâ€™s any function to execute and processes tasks from the task queues (Macrotask and Microtask) in an orderly fashion.  
Macrotasks (also known as tasks) are tasks that are scheduled to run after the current script completes. These include:  
- setTimeout
- setInterval
- I/O operations
- UI rendering tasks  
  
Microtasks are smaller tasks that are scheduled to run immediately after the currently executing script and before any Macrotask. These include:  
- Promises (.then, .catch, .finally)
- MutationObserver
- Queueing a Microtask via queueMicrotask  
```
// Macrotask: setTimeout
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Macrotask: Timeout');
}, 0);

// Microtask: Promise
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log('Microtask: Promise 1');
}).then(() => {
    console.log('Microtask: Promise 2');
});
```
