### Compare  let vs  var with your own code examples.

```js
function scopeTest() {
    if (true) {
        var x = 10; // function-scoped
        let y = 20; // block-scoped
    }
    console.log(x); // 10 (accessible because var is function-scoped)
    console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined (let is block-scoped)
}

scopeTest();

// ====================================================================

console.log(a); // undefined (var is hoisted and initialized with undefined)
var a = 5;

console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
let b = 10;

// ====================================================================
var c = 1;
var c = 2; // No error, var allows re-declaration
console.log(c); // 2

let d = 3;
let d = 4; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'd' has already been declared

// ====================================================================
var e = "hello";
let f = "world";

console.log(window.e); // "hello" (e is a property of the global object)
console.log(window.f); // undefined (f is not a property of the global object)

```



### Event Loop, Macrotask, and Microtask Explained with Code Samples

#### **Event Loop**

The event loop is a process that constantly checks if the call stack is empty, and if it is, it pushes the first task from the task queue to the call stack. The event loop ensures that tasks are executed in the correct order and that the browser remains responsive.

#### **Macrotask**

Macrotasks (also known as tasks) include operations such as:

- `setTimeout`
- `setInterval`
- I/O tasks
- UI rendering

Macrotasks are placed in the task queue, which is processed by the event loop.

#### **Microtask**

Microtasks include operations such as:

- `Promise` callbacks (`.then`, `.catch`, `.finally`)
- `process.nextTick` in Node.js
- MutationObserver callbacks

Microtasks are placed in the microtask queue, which has a higher priority than the macrotask queue. After each macrotask, the event loop checks the microtask queue and processes all the microtasks before moving on to the next macrotask.

### Code Example with Explanation

```js
console.log("Start"); // 1

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Macrotask 1"); // 6 (Macrotask)
}, 0);

Promise.resolve()
    .then(() => {
        console.log("Microtask 1"); // 3 (Microtask)
    })
    .then(() => {
        console.log("Microtask 2"); // 4 (Microtask)
    });

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Macrotask 2"); // 7 (Macrotask)
}, 0);

console.log("End"); // 2
```

#### **Explanation of Execution Order:**

1. **`console.log("Start");`** is executed first because it’s a simple synchronous operation.
2. **`setTimeout(() => {...}, 0);`** schedules a macrotask (`Macrotask 1`) to run after the call stack is empty. It's added to the macrotask queue.
3. **`Promise.resolve().then(...)`** schedules the first microtask (`Microtask 1`) in the microtask queue. Since it is a promise, the microtask is added to the microtask queue immediately after the synchronous code finishes.
4. **Another `Promise.then(...)`** schedules the second microtask (`Microtask 2`) in the microtask queue, which will run after the first microtask is completed.
5. **`setTimeout(() => {...}, 0);`** schedules another macrotask (`Macrotask 2`) in the macrotask queue.
6. **`console.log("End");`** is executed next because it’s also a synchronous operation.
7. The call stack is now empty, so the event loop first checks the microtask queue:
   - **`Microtask 1`** is executed.
   - **`Microtask 2`** is executed next.
8. After all microtasks are processed, the event loop moves to the macrotask queue:
   - **`Macrotask 1`** is executed.
   - **`Macrotask 2`** is executed.
