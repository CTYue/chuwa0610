1. Read and practice all sample codes from 71-Dom-Bom-JavaScript-Typescript-Node.md on your local
   browser or an online compiler.
2. Compare let vs var with your own code examples.
   Hereâ€™s a demonstration of the difference between `let` and `var` in JavaScript with runnable code examples:



- **Scope Differences:**
    - `var` is **function-scoped**, meaning it is accessible anywhere within the function it is declared.
    - `let` is **block-scoped**, meaning it is only accessible within the block (e.g., within an `if` or `for` block) where it is declared.

```javascript
function scopeTest() {
    if (true) {
        var x = 10;
        let y = 20;
    }
    console.log(x); // 10 - 'var' is function-scoped, so it can be accessed here.
    console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined - 'let' is block-scoped, so it cannot be accessed outside the block.
}

scopeTest();
```
- **Hoisting Differences:**
    - Variables declared with `var` are **hoisted** to the top of their scope and are initialized with `undefined`.
    - Variables declared with `let` are also hoisted but are not initialized. Accessing them before the declaration will result in a `ReferenceError`.

```javascript
function hoistingTest() {
    console.log(a); // undefined - 'var' is hoisted but not initialized.
    console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization - 'let' is hoisted but not initialized.

    var a = 10;
    let b = 20;
}

hoistingTest();
```
- **Re-declaration Differences:**
    - `var` allows the re-declaration of the same variable within the same scope without errors.
    - `let` does not allow re-declaration within the same scope, and attempting to do so will cause a `SyntaxError`.
```javascript
function redeclarationTest() {
    var z = 30;
    var z = 40; // No error - 'var' allows re-declaration within the same scope.
    console.log(z); // 40

    let w = 50;
    // let w = 60; // Uncommenting this will cause a SyntaxError - 'let' does not allow re-declaration within the same scope.
    console.log(w);
}

redeclarationTest();
```
3. Write an HTML page that generates a lucky number based on the date, time, and user inputs. Users
   should be able to get their random lucky numbers by clicking a button or using the enter key after typing
   the input.

4. Write an HTML page that returns a user's GitHub repos (https://api.github.com/users/{user_id}/repos) in
   JSON format. The web page should have a text box and a submit button where users can provide the
   GitHub user ID. The fetch call should be asynchronous. If the call to the above API fails for any reason, you
   should return a customized, user-friendly error message. If you know more than one approach to
   implement the asynchronous call, please do it using different approaches.
5. Explain Event Loop, Macrotask, and Microtask with code samples.
