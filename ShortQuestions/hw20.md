## 2.  Compare  let vs  var with your own code examples.
* var is function-scoped.
* let is block-scoped.
``` javaScript
function testScope() {
    if (true) {
        var x = 10;  // function-scoped
        let y = 20;  // block-scoped
    }
    console.log(x); 
    console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
}
testScope();
```

* Variables declared with var can be re-declared in the same scope.
* Variables declared with let cannot be re-declared in the same scope.
``` javaScript
var x = 1;
var x = 2;  // No error, x is re-declared and re-assigned

let y = 3;
let y = 4;  // SyntaxError: Identifier 'y' has already been declared
```

## 3.  Write an HTML page that generates a lucky number based on the date, time, and user inputs. Users should be able to get their random lucky numbers by clicking a button or using the enter key after typing the input.
* in Coding

## 4.  Write an HTML page that returns a user's GitHub repos (https://api.github.com/users/{user_id}/repos) in JSON format. The web page should have a text box and a submit button where users can provide the GitHub user ID. The fetch call should be asynchronous. If the call to the above API fails for any reason, you should return a customized, user-friendly error message. If you know more than one approach to implement the asynchronous call, please do it using different approaches.

## 5.  Explain Event Loop, Macrotask, and Microtask with code samples.
 
* Event Loop: The event loop is responsible for managing the execution of code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks (macrotasks and microtasks). The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty and if there are tasks in the queue that need to be executed.

* Macrotask: Macrotasks are tasks that are scheduled by functions like setTimeout, setInterval, or I/O operations. When a macrotask is executed, the event loop handles one macrotask at a time and then moves to the microtask queue before executing the next macrotask.

* Microtask: Microtasks are smaller tasks that usually need to be processed immediately after the currently executing script or after a macrotask completes. Promises and MutationObserver are examples of microtasks. The event loop always checks the microtask queue after every macrotask.
``` javaScript

// Macrotask
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('setTimeout'); // 3
}, 0);

// Microtask
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('Promise 1'); // 1
});

// Another Microtask
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('Promise 2'); // 2
});

// Another Macrotask
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('setTimeout 2'); // 4
}, 0);


```
