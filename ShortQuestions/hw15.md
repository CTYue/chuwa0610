1. Explain following concepts:

   1. Docker daemon

      >The Docker daemon, `dockerd`, is a background service that manages the Docker containers on a host. It handles the tasks associated with running containers based on Docker images, such as building, distributing, and orchestrating containers. The daemon listens for Docker API requests and can communicate with other Docker daemons to manage Docker services.

   2. Docker host

      >A Docker host is a physical or virtual machine that runs the Docker daemon, allowing it to host and manage container instances. It provides the runtime environment for containers, handling the systemâ€™s resources that Docker needs to execute containers.

   3. Docker Registry

      >A Docker registry is a storage and content delivery system, holding Docker images. Registries can be public or private. The most well-known public registry is Docker Hub, which hosts thousands of Docker images that users can download and use. Private registries can be set up within an organization to store and manage proprietary images securely.

   4. Image/Image Tag

      >A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. Images are built from a series of layers that represent instructions in the Dockerfile. An image tag is a label applied to an image in a Docker registry that distinguishes different versions of the same image. For example, tags can be used to manage different versions of an application or different configurations.

   5. Container Volume

      >A container volume is a persistent data storage mechanism that allows data to be kept even after a container is deleted. Volumes are managed by the Docker host and are completely independent of the lifecycle of a container. This means that volumes allow for data persistence across container updates and restarts. They can also be shared among multiple containers.

   6. Docker Namespace

      >Docker uses namespaces to provide isolation between containers. A namespace is essentially a layer of abstraction that makes it appear to each container as though it has its own instance of the global resource. Namespaces help avoid conflicts between containers and maintain container isolation from the host system. Types of namespaces in Docker include PID (Process ID), Net (Network), IPC (Inter-Process Communication), MNT (Mount), and UTS (Hostname and NIS domain name).

2. Dockerize you lastest home work project.

3. Save and build it.

4. If your application depends on more than one docker base image, please make above as a docker compose execution.

5. Try mapping host file path to contain's file path, or vice versa.

6. Test and verify if your app's functionalities remain same after Dockerization.
