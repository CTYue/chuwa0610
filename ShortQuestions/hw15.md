1. **What are Resilience patterns? What is circuit breaker?**
    
    Resilience pattern are designed to help application handle unexpected failures during runtime. In the distributed systems where multiple services depend on each other, the failure of one service may cause the broke of the entire system. Resilience pattern support automatically retry, timeout, circuit breaker, bulkhead, fallback, rate limiting.
    
    Resilience pattern use circuit breaker pattern to enhance the stability, the pattern stops the application thatâ€™s likely to fail.
    
2. **how to do load balance in microservice? Write a long Summary by yourself.**
    
    Load balancing is used to distribute incoming requests across all the availiable service instance, optimized resource utilization, providing fault torlerance. 
    
    Load balancing algorithm including:
    
    Round robin: distributes requests sequentially among the servers.
    
    Least connnections: routes new request to server with the fewest active connections.
    
    Hash-Based: Routes requests based on a hash of some part of the request to ensure a client consistently reaches the same server.
    
    Weighted Algorithms: each server assigned a weight based on their capacity.
    
    To implement load balancing, we can use 
    
    1. service mesh
    2. cloud load balancers like AWS, Azure
    3. container tools like Kubernates and docker
3. **How to do service discovery?**
    
    Service discovery allows service to find the network location of other services which they need to connect. The popular tools for service discovery including Eureka, Nacos etc

if consumer is more than the partitions, some consumer will not be assigned partition.
