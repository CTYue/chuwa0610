## 1. Explain following concepts:
1. Docker Daemon
   **Summary:** The Docker daemon (dockerd) is a background service running on the Docker host that manages Docker images, containers, networks, and storage volumes.
   
   **Key Points:**
   - Background service
   - Manages Docker objects
   - Handles API requests

2. Docker Host
   **Summary:** The Docker host is the machine (physical or virtual) where the Docker daemon runs. It provides the environment to execute Docker commands and manage containers.
   
   **Key Points:**
   - Machine running Docker daemon
   - Executes Docker commands
   - Manages containers and other Docker objects

3. Docker Registry
   **Summary:** A Docker registry is a storage and content delivery system for Docker images. It can be public (like Docker Hub) or private.
   
   **Key Points:**
   - Stores Docker images
   - Public (Docker Hub) or private
   - Facilitates image distribution

4. Image/Image Tag
   **Summary:** A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software. An image tag is a label to identify different versions of an image.
   
   **Key Points:**
   - Lightweight, standalone package
   - Includes application and dependencies
   - Image tag identifies versions

5. Container Volume
   **Summary:** A container volume is a storage mechanism to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. It allows data to be shared between the host and containers or among containers.
   
   **Key Points:**
   - Persists container data
   - Shares data between host and containers
   - Facilitates data sharing among containers

6. Docker Namespace
   **Summary:** Docker namespaces provide isolation and partitioning of resources (like processes, network, and mounts) to ensure containers are isolated from each other and the host system.
   
   **Key Points:**
   - Resource isolation
   - Ensures container isolation
   - Types: PID, network, mount, etc.

## 2. Dockerize your latest homework project.
   - Save and build it.
   - If your application depends on more than one docker base image, please make above as a docker compose execution.
   - Try mapping host file path to container's file path, or vice versa.
   - Test and verify if your app's functionalities remain same after Dockerization.
