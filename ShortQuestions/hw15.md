Explain following concepts:
1. Docker Daemon:
The Docker daemon, also called dockerd, is a background process that manages Docker objects like images, containers, networks, and volumes.
It listens for commands from the Docker client (usually the docker command-line tool) and carries them out.
It's the core of Docker on your system, responsible for the lifecycle of containers and ensuring they run smoothly.

2. Docker Host:
The Docker host is the physical machine or virtual machine where the Docker daemon is running.
It provides the resources (CPU, memory, storage) that Docker containers use to execute applications.
You can have Docker installed on various systems like Linux, Windows, or macOS, making each system a potential Docker host.

3. Docker Registry:
A Docker registry is a service that stores and distributes Docker images.
It acts like a library where you can find and download pre-built images for various applications (e.g., web servers, databases).
You can also push your own custom images to a registry to share them with others or for private use.
Popular public registries include Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/_/registry) and private registries can be hosted by organizations for internal use.

4. Image/Image Tag:
Image: An image is a read-only template that contains the instructions for creating a Docker container. It includes the operating system, application code, libraries, and configuration files needed to run the application.
Image Tag: An image tag is a human-readable identifier for a specific version or variant of an image. It allows you to differentiate between different versions of the same image (e.g., ubuntu:latest, ubuntu:18.04).
When you pull an image from a registry, you typically specify the image name along with the tag (e.g., docker pull ubuntu:latest). If no tag is specified, latest is used by default.

5. Container Volume:
A container volume is a directory or file on the Docker host that is mounted into a container.
This allows persistent data to be stored outside the container, which is important because containers are ephemeral (their data is lost when they stop).
Any changes made to the volume data within the container are reflected on the host system and vice versa. This enables persistent storage of application data or configuration.

6. Docker Namespace:
Namespaces are a core Linux kernel feature that Docker utilizes to isolate running containers. They provide a virtualized view of system resources like processes, file systems, network interfaces, and more.
Different types of Docker namespaces exist:
Process Namespace (PID namespace): Isolates the container's view of running processes.
Mount Namespace (MNT namespace): Isolates the container's view of the mounted file system.
UTS Namespace (UTS namespace): Isolates the container's hostname and domain name.
Network Namespace (NET namespace): Isolates the container's network configuration and allows for creating private networks for containers to communicate.
User Namespace (USER namespace): Isolates the container's view of user accounts and permissions (optional).
