1. Explain following concepts:

   1. **Docker Daemon**

   The Docker daemon (`dockerd`) is a background service running on the host machine that manages Docker containers, images, networks, and storage volumes. It listens for Docker API requests and processes them. The daemon creates and manages Docker objects, such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.

   2. **Docker Host**

   A Docker host is the physical or virtual machine where the Docker daemon runs. It provides the environment for containers to run. The Docker host can be a local machine, a server in a data center, or a cloud-based instance. Essentially, it is any system that can run Docker and manage containers.

   3. **Docker Registry**

   A Docker registry is a centralized storage and distribution system for Docker images. It stores Docker images and allows users to push (upload) and pull (download) images. The most well-known public registry is Docker Hub, but organizations can also run private registries. Docker registries facilitate the sharing and deployment of images.

   4. **Image/Image Tag**

   A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. Images are built from a Dockerfile and can be versioned using tags. An image tag is a label applied to a Docker image to distinguish different versions or configurations of the image. For example, `nginx:latest` or `nginx:1.18`.

   5. **Container Volume**

   A Docker volume is a mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. Volumes enable data to persist beyond the lifecycle of a container and can be shared between multiple containers. They provide a way to decouple the storage from the container, allowing data to be stored in a consistent and reliable manner.

   6. **Docker Namespace**

   Docker uses namespaces to provide isolation between containers. Namespaces ensure that each container has its own unique environment, including its own set of process IDs, network interfaces, and file system hierarchy. This isolation allows containers to run independently without interfering with each other or the host system. Common namespaces include PID namespace (process isolation), Network namespace (network stack isolation), and Mount namespace (file system isolation).
