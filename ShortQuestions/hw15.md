1. **Docker daemon**: The Docker daemon (dockerd) is a background service running on the host machine that manages Docker images, containers, networks, and storage volumes. It listens for API requests and performs container operations.
2. **Docker host**: The Docker host is the physical or virtual machine on which the Docker daemon runs. This can be a local machine, a remote server, or a cloud-based instance.
3. **Docker Registry**: A Docker Registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images. Docker Hub is the most commonly used public registry, but private registries can also be set up for specific organizational needs.
4. **Image/Image Tag**: A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and environment variables. An image tag is a specific version of an image, typically denoted by a version number or a descriptive name like `latest`.
5. **Container Volume**: A container volume is a mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. Volumes are managed by Docker and can be used to share data between containers or between a container and the host machine.
6. **Docker Namespace**: Docker namespaces provide a layer of isolation for containers, ensuring that processes within a container do not interfere with those in other containers or the host system. Namespaces include process IDs, network interfaces, and file system mounts, among other resources.

2.  Dockerize you lastest home work project.

3.  Save and build it.

4.  If your application depends on more than one docker base image, please make above as a docker

compose execution.

5.  Try mapping host file path to contain's file path, or vice versa.

6.  Test and verify if your app's functionalities remain same after Dockerization.
