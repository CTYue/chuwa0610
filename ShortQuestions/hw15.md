1. Docker daemon: The server-side component of the Docker Engine that runs as a background process on the host system. It is responsible for creating, managing, and orchestrating containers
2. Docker host: The machine on which the Docker daemon is running. It can be the local machine, a remote server, or a virtual machine.
3. Docker Registry: A registry is a location where we can store and distribute Docker images. Public registries, such as Docker Hub, are available for sharing images, while Docker Registry can be used to create private registries. Additionally, cloud-based registry services, like AWS Elastic Container Registry(ECR), can be utilized to easily set up personal public or private registries.
4. Image/Image Tag: Docker Images are read-only templates used to create Docker containers. They contain the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configurations required for an application to run. Docker image tage is human-readable labels used to identify and version Docker images.
5. Container Volume: container volume is a mechanism for persisting data generated and used by Docker containers. They enable data to be shared between containers and to persist even if the container is deleted. Volume provides a way to decouple the lifecycle of the data from the lifecycle of the containers.
6. Docker Namespace: Docker namespace is a fundamental aspect of container technology, providing isolation between containers and between containers and the host system. Namespaces enable containers to have their own isolated view of the system, making it possible for multiple containers to run on the same host without interfering with each other.
