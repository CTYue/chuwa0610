1. Explain following concepts:
- 1.  Docker daemon
- 2.  Docker host
- 3.  Docker Registry
- 4.  Image/Image Tag
- 5.  Container Volume
- 6.  Docker Namespace
      Sure, here are explanations for each of these Docker concepts:

### 1. Docker Daemon
The Docker daemon (`dockerd`) is a background service running on the host machine. It's responsible for managing Docker objects like images, containers, networks, and volumes. The daemon listens for Docker API requests and can communicate with other Docker daemons to manage Docker services.

### 2. Docker Host
A Docker host is the machine that runs the Docker daemon. It can be a physical machine, a virtual machine, or a cloud instance. The host is where Docker containers are executed and managed.

### 3. Docker Registry
A Docker registry is a storage and content delivery system for Docker images. It can be public or private. The default public registry is Docker Hub, which allows users to push and pull images. Private registries can be set up for more secure and controlled environments.

### 4. Image/Image Tag
A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. An image tag is a label applied to a Docker image that distinguishes different versions of the image. For example, in `nginx:latest`, `nginx` is the image name and `latest` is the tag.

### 5. Container Volume
A Docker volume is a way to persist data generated and used by Docker containers. Volumes are stored outside the container's filesystem, making them persistent across container restarts and ensuring data is not lost when containers are removed. They are managed by Docker and can be shared among multiple containers.

### 6. Docker Namespace
Namespaces in Docker provide a way to isolate and partition kernel resources used by containers. They ensure that each container has its own isolated environment. Different types of namespaces include:
- **PID namespace**: isolates process IDs.
- **NET namespace**: isolates network interfaces.
- **IPC namespace**: isolates interprocess communication.
- **UTS namespace**: isolates hostname and domain name.
- **MNT namespace**: isolates filesystem mount points.
- **USER namespace**: isolates user and group IDs.

Each of these namespaces helps ensure that containers operate in their own isolated environments, preventing conflicts and ensuring security.
2. Dockerize you lastest home work project
- 1. Dockerize you lastest home work project.
- 2. Save and build it.
- 3. If your application depends on more than one docker base image, please make above as a docker
    compose execution.
- 4. Try mapping host file path to contain's file path, or vice versa.
- 5. Test and verify if your app's functionalities remain same after Dockerization.

Tried with POST and GET works perfectly.
