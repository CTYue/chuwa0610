## 1. Explain following concepts:

### 1. Docker daemon
- The Docker daemon (dockerd) is a background service that manages Docker containers. It listens for Docker API requests, handles Docker objects like images, containers, networks, and volumes, and ensures the containers run as expected.

### 2. Docker host
- A Docker host is the physical or virtual machine where the Docker daemon runs. It provides the environment for creating, running, and managing Docker containers.

### 3. Docker Registry
- A storage and distribution system for Docker images. Public registries like Docker Hub and private registries allow you to share and deploy container images.

### 4. Image/Image Tag
- A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone package of software that includes everything needed to run it. An image tag is a label that refers to a specific version of an image.

### 5. Container Volume
- A storage mechanism in Docker that allows data to persist beyond the lifecycle of a container. Volumes can be shared and reused among multiple containers.

### 6. Docker Namespace
- A feature that provides isolation for various aspects of containers, such as process IDs, network, user IDs, and mounts, ensuring containers are isolated from each other and the host system.

## 2. Dockerize you lastest home work project.

## 3. Save and build it.

## 4. If your application depends on more than one docker base image, please make above as a docker compose execution.

## 5. Try mapping host file path to contain's file path, or vice versa.

## 6. Test and verify if your app's functionalities remain same after Dockerization.
