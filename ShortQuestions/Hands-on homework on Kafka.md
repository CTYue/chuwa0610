# Hands-on homework on Kafka

## Step 1: Use following docker-compose file to start 3 brokers on your computer, this docker-compose also includes a kafka visualization tool, once your containers started, you may visit http://localhost:8080/ to get everything about your brokers and topicsâ€¦ (edited) 
See [docker-compose.yml](..%2FCoding%2Fhw18%2Fdocker-compose.yml)

## Step 2: Run https://github.com/CTYue/Spring-Producer-Consumer/ on your local, only producer is included in this repo as of now. (edited) 
See [DemoApplication.java](..%2FCoding%2Fhw18%2FSpring-Producer-Consumer-main%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fchuwa%2Fdemo%2FDemoApplication.java)

## Step 3: Write your consumer application with Spring Kafka dependency, set up 3 consumers in a single consumer group.
See [KafkaConsumerService.java](..%2FCoding%2Fhw18%2FSpring-Producer-Consumer-main%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fchuwa%2Fdemo%2Fservice%2FKafkaConsumerService.java)
- Prove message consumption with screenshots.
  - In the center is the consumers set up with 3 consumers.
  - In the left conner is the postman sending message.
  - In the right conner is the consumer printing out received messages.
  - On the right is the webUi showing the customer with 3 consumers(consumer_group)

- Increase number of consumers in a single consumer group, observe what happens, explain your observation.
- With 3 partitions:
  - 2 Consumers: A consumer is assigned to multiple partitions.
  - 3 Consumers: Each consumer is assigned to one partition.
  - 4 Consumers: 3 consumers are assigned to the 3 partitions, and 1 consumer remains idle.
