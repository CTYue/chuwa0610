1. What is Generic in Java?
Generics allow you to define classes, interfaces, and methods with type parameters. This provides type safety by allowing you to specify the type of objects that a collection or other data structure can hold.

5.  Discuss best practices on nullptr exception prevention, provide code snippet for each practice that you mentioned.
Optional:
Optional<String> optional = Optional.ofNullable(someString);
optional.ifPresent(System.out::println);

Null Checks:
if (someObject != null) {
    someObject.doSomething();
}

Default Values:
String value = someObject != null ? someObject.getValue() : "default";

6.  Discuss Java 8 new features with code snippet.
Lambda Expressions:
list.forEach(item -> System.out.println(item));

Stream API:
List<String> filtered = list.stream().filter(s -> s.startsWith("a")).collect(Collectors.toList());

Optional:
Optional<String> optional = Optional.of("Hello");
optional.ifPresent(System.out::println);


7.  What are the advantages of the Optional class?
Avoids null checks and NullPointerExceptions.
Provides a clear method to indicate that a value might be absent.
Offers methods to handle the absence of values in a clean and functional way.

8.  Explain Functional Interface and Lambda with code samples.
Functional Interface:
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunctionalInterface {
    void execute();
}

Lambda Expression:
MyFunctionalInterface myFunc = () -> System.out.println("Executing");
myFunc.execute();

9.  Explain Method Reference with code samples?
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c");
list.forEach(System.out::println);

10.  Explain "Lambda can use unchanged variable outside of lambda", with code snippet.
String prefix = "Hello, ";
Consumer<String> greeter = name -> System.out.println(prefix + name);
greeter.accept("World");


11.  Can a functional interface extend/inherit another interface?
Yes, a functional interface can extend another interface as long as it doesn't add any new abstract methods.

12.  What are Intermediate and Terminal operations?
Intermediate Operations: Return a new stream (e.g., filter, map).
Terminal Operations: Return a result or produce a side-effect (e.g., collect, forEach).

13.  Demontrate the most commonly used Intermediate operations in Stream API, with code snippet.
filter
stream.filter(s -> s.startsWith("a"));
map:
stream.map(String::toUpperCase);
sorted:
stream.sorted();

14.  How are Collections different from Stream?
Collections: Store and manage data, support modifications, can be iterated multiple times.
Stream: Provide a functional approach to processing sequences of elements, support operations that produce a result, typically consumed once.
